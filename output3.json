Two sisters, very close, then one of them gets engaged to be married, which leaves the younger sister feeling a little deserted. So far, so normal. You can immediately see how the plot will develop. Younger sister tries to break up the couple, falls out with older sister, but then has an epiphany and discovers her future brother in law is a wonderful person and everyone hugs and lives happily ever after. Deception that's not what happens. It kind of does for a while, but gets progressively more and more surreal. Many will watch this movie and think it went totally off the rails. But I just found myself laughing - partly because it was, yes, silly, but mainly because it was fun. And we didn't really need another predictable \"boy meets girl and other girl/boy gets upset\" movie, did we?"},

If you have ever wondered what it might look like if Quentin Tarantino consulted on a modernized Pakistani version of Jane Austen ... well, writer-director Nida Manzoor shows us (with no actual assistance from QT), including stylized martial arts, class warfare, and an obsession with a stuntwoman career. It's Ms. Manzoor's first feature film (she created the TV series \"We are Lady Parts\") and she presents an extremely creative film with a balance of silly and dark themes that proves immensely entertaining."},

I get what they are trying to do but it ends up cliched, predictable and silly beyond what I was willing to accept because of poor execution.

The lead is good and supported by two actors as her friends that add good comedic value. The rest of the cast is fine nothing special. But they all deserved better."},

Working Title Films, the production company, has a fine record in comedy and action films such as 4 Weddings to which I couldn't help comparing this while I watched it. But the clunkiest line in that rom-com (\"Is it raining? I hadn't noticed\") is Wildean compared to the best here. The lead character, Ria Khan (Priya Kansara) repeats the trailer's echoed line \"I am the fury\" on numerous occasions, none of them funny or effective. Strangely, her character - well educated in a private school - seems to think that training to enter her desired career in movie stunts requires nothing apart from learning one martial art."},

Priya Kansara and Ritu Arya play sisters that treat life with unorthodox flair. It took a few scenes to realize these girls had questionable decision-making abilities. A few scenes after that, there's a kung fu fight between Ria (Priya) and a school bully. From that point on, you know this movie doesn't take itself seriously. It's funny throughout, and they build on prior jokes with masterful precision. I had no expectations going in and came out a winner. This movie will make you smile. I've seen it a couple more times since, and each time I find something else that I missed the first time around. The plot is good, the soundtrack is great and acting, superb. Better than a \"Marvel or a Star War\"."},

The sisters (played by Priya Kansara and Ritu Arya) are total showstealers and I enjoyed both their performances. People aren't wrong in saying Polite Society looks straight out of Edgar Wright's playbook - it features rich and opaque frames, the presence of absurd humour (there's an entire fight scene between the sisters in the house, and none of the wounds from it show in the subsequent scenes), quirky edits & slo-mos, some flashy typeface, and the effective use of music - the only thing missing was a Simon Pegg cameo."},

Her characters are wonderfully engaging, demanding that you root for them. I enjoyed every minute of watching these women embrace their power. Hollywood take note: female audiences are hungry for more unapologetically strong, opinionated women. I only wish more female directors of color had opportunities to tell their stories. What a far more interesting place the world would be. I also loved the soundtrack. You can tell that Manzoor loves music the way she mixes genres to emphasize the story. What a great use of the X-ray Spex song \"Identity.\""},

That involves his sexually ambiguous and brutal brother \"Cuco\" (Beau Knapp) who decides, quite cleverly, that he will kidnap the daughter of \"Doc\" and force him to do their dirty work for them... What now ensues is just poor, sorry. It's like a video-shoot 'em up game with bodies falling all over the place and little if any jeopardy until the last few minutes when, even then, the ending has precious little by way of surprise. The plot itself is pretty preposterous and the acting does little to inject any real sense of menace to this procedural, repetitive and over-long training video for would-be ten year old assassins. I wouldn't bother if I were you."},

He gets a bit of a shock, though, when his new boss sends him back to the benches where he must, again, actually practice law. It's here, after a night on the booze, that he turns up to defend a woman charged with the negligent homicide of her young son. A combination of his laziness, incompetence and his hangover leaves this woman hung out to dry when one of the witnesses - from whom he didn't get a written deposition - changes his story. Off to jail she goes and into a maelstrom of despair goes he before the guilt starts to kick in, and he decides to get his act together. His co-defending counsel \"Evelyn\" from the original trial (Renci Yeung) and he decide to try and convince the convicted \"Jolene\" (Louise Wong) to let them work on an appeal and the remainder of this rather flat courtroom drama follows their efforts. It starts off quite entertainingly, with a bit of a tetchy dynamic between the lawyers and to be fair, Dayo Wong is quite proficient as the bored and rather indolent lawyer. Sadly, though, once the ship is all upright again, the story becomes one of rather predicable family intrigue and power-broking that exposes us to many from a supporting cast that are as unremarkable as the dialogue. The photography has something of a television feature to it and the denouement, though quite lively paced - well you can see that coming from space. At 2¼ hours it is also far too long with just not enough meat on the story to sustain it. Perhaps a more judiciously cut edit and a few fewer side-stories might have made it more of a watchable \"Perry Mason\" style drama, but as it is - I was a bit bored by the end."},

What hooks audience is the anticipation to see how those moneyed, callous bastards to be vanquished despite of their insuperable privileges, and Ng's film doesn't disappoint in this regard, in particular when the senior prosecutor (Tse Kwan-Ho, inimitably august and inscrutably righteous) shifts his ground and lays into the culprit, although juridically speaking, some of the elocution smacks of fanfaronade, tailored to create some semblance of a rousing contentment which has been deployed ad nauseam in similar situations, at the end of the day, justice must prevails, and audience feel good about it.

I enjoy Dayo Wong shows for his comedy and integrity, but he was kind of overacted when it comes to movies, which needs to be a bit more subtle and down to earth to meet with the reality, but in spite with all the flaws he does kind of carry through with the character. The most important part of the movie is the message it conveys, which is common sense, justice, truth, human rights and humanity, things that the courts in Hong Kong has certainly lost in recent years. The judicial system is totally bent to meet political propaganda rather than justice and truth and a total disregard of human rights. This movie is a good call for the countless cases of wrongly accused for the protestors and legislators in recent years, which were unjustly convicted with over extended periods of jail time, yet these ugly judges and attorney generals have no shame in putting out these unfair trails and sentences in collusion with the political propaganda. There's a great message in the movie : \"ARE YOU EVEN HUMAN BEING?\" is a great reflection of these scumbags."},

It picked up the pace after half an hour or so. The.plot of movie may probably be repetitive, therefore a bit monotonous. However, the screenplay and the quirky comedies and the situational hilarity rendered it to be a good entertainment. It does indeed clock above average in terms of entertainment quotient unlike most Malayalam movies which are quite very deeply serious affairs."},

Situational comedies in the movie are the best that have been seen in recent movies. But it was quite relaxing to watch this amidst of current dark themed movies running. The movie is intended for malayalees only so that other natives would not find the movie a good one. The movie is focused on comedy and entertainment rather than a serious or realistic movie."},

So many perspectives on coal are black and white -- this one explores the complex and historical relationship with coal of the people who live and work with it. It does not demonize coal or coal miners, nor does it whitewash the devastating effects of the industry on the land and people. For once Appalachians are portrayed in a nuanced, compassionate way, and with the perspective provided you come to understand how and why coal has helped and hindered Appalachia. It took me several days to conclude what I had been trying to figure out:\nThis film is art, not just a simple documentary. It braves the risk of presenting a story within the story, focusing on a child and how she grows up with the complicated realities of her region. The stunning visuals made me eager for others to see past the stereotypes into the beauty that is this sacred place. Well done, Ms. Sheldon."},

Many people agree that America needs new stories to live by. The story we lived by in Appalachia for a century expired twenty years ago, so Appalachia has wisdom to share. King Coal is an extraordinary elegy for the \"King\" in the title. Then the film goes farther and nudges us to consider ways to move forward that are not dystopia or fantasy. What I love most about the film is how Sheldon shows us that the resources we need for the future are ones we in Appalachia have had all along: unity, ingenuity, resilience, community, integrity, imagination, and above all, humanity.

If that means a girl rents a house, then I guess it's correct. But I'm guessing the film-makers wanted to imply that the supernatural elements which befall her are the part which is supposed to be real. I guess if you make it until the end you'll realise which parts were supposed to be 'real' and which weren't. Um, that's pretty much a summary of the movie. A girl - Julia Fields, would you believe! - moved into a rented house in Florida where she's slowly stalked by more and more supernatural events and entities."},

It wasn't bad but it wasn't good..The story is a true story so they could have really took this to another level and built some substance. The main actress' acting was robotic and almost cringe. I couldn't get lost in the movie because they weren't selling me on their roles. It was obvious they are actors. Bless their hearts they tried... it could have been scarier but kinda felt like a fever dream instead. There were a few creepy parts though. I think they could have added scarier music to make you feel unease and get your adrenaline pumping. The end is really rushed and there is no build up. It just kinda wraps up where you are left wondering what just happened and you're wanting more substance and detail."},

Whether you're already a fan of one of the series or both, there's a very good chance you'll thoroughly enjoy this movie. All the characters are present and accounted for, retaining their signature humor and penchant for crazy action, and they interact in a way that really clicks. Lupin does seem to carry a significant portion of the exposition, but the film also provides some heartfelt and eagerly anticipated expansions to the lore surrounding the Cats characters. The action sequences are wonderfully directed, and if you happen to have a 5.1 surround sound system at your disposal, the combination of cinematic mayhem and jazzy music will provide an incredibly immersive and powerful audio experience."},

I grew up with both shows in the 80s, and I worshipped Cat's Eye, read all the manga, watched all the anime. So when I saw this title on Amazon Prime, I was excited to watch it. But what a disappointment it was. The anime style and character design is so bad and amateur that not only it was distracting, I actually started getting a headache from watching the whole 93 minutes of the movie. The story premise had potential, but it became more stupid as the minutes went by. I could see the plot twist pretty much the minute the character involved in the twist showed up at the beginning of the movie. Whoever wrote the story completely butchered the beloved characters - Lupin was never charming or likable, even after they tried giving him a heart of gold. He just seemed like a total a-hole. The Kisugi sisters (the Cat's Eye trio) were so naive and dumb, not at all cunning and smart like they were in the manga or anime. Even their action scenes came off as cheap acrobat tricks, no elegance or grace. The villains were completely laughable, and all the supporting characters are boring and forgettable, even Fujiko was lame. It's almost like the writer(s) has never studied the original works that this movie was based on. What a shame that a new generation of viewers were introduced to these amazing characters in such an awful way. I highly recommend skipping this lame-fest and watch the original animes from the 80s/90s instead."},

Not to mention the relationship between Lupin and AI was very touching and sibling-like. Only downside would be the villains but it was a minor nitpick and the rest of the characters more than made up for it.

The whole film drags and moves forward so slowly at snail's pace. The plot is not interesting at all and is just a routine hero against corrupt organisation thing, with that same old social message stuff, that we have seen countless number of times before. And even after keeping all things considered, it doesn't even manages to entertain as well - which was it's main job. The whole setup, camera work, dialogues, cinematography and the action feels so outdated. Even the performances by the leads were not appropriate, it seemed they aren't interested in this film too. And direction is very weak. Overall Kranti is a train wreck and I won't recommend this at all."},

One side we see new talents making some extraordinary movies which gets success allover India & global appreciation. On the other side senior star actors with high budget are making some trash. Kranti as the name says revolution & it's a revolution in education field... Private school mafia their fee structure, donation and how they loot poor. But this kind of story has been tried and tested n no.of times so nothing new. Darshan again picks the same story and adds nothing new to it... Yuvarathna did the same mistake. Nobody gives a solution they just showcase the loopholes which is known to every citizen. Harikrishna should stop direction coz it's not his cup of tea. No doubt he is a good music director & should concentrate more on music. Harikrishna is still in Yajamana hangover where he show cooking oil mafia exploiting farmers. Here it's education private schools. First half of the movie lags alot coz of slow screenplay, Darshan is repeating the same mistake again n again same kind of dialogue delivery, non-synchronised stunts, poor VFX literally makes the viewer laugh. He should come out of his comfort zone and experiment new stories. Same old mass masala where whole movie is hero based self centred story doesn't work. May be his fans will like whatever he does but there should be some limit. If it gets repeated Darshan's film career will be on stake nothing else."},

The built-in English subtitles were horribly translated, too small, and on screen for only a second or so, thus the dialogue was hard to follow. If you're out of action films to watch, I'd say give this one a go if you're bored, it's only a brisk 80 min viewing, although you may have to rewind a bunch of times to try and make out the subtitles."},

The film has interesting action sequences and Arjun, played by Anshuman Jha has caught the nuances of classic hand-to-hand combat with finesse. Apart from the action, the story revolves around Arjun, his love for animals and till what extend he can go to protect the helpless animals. Which most Indians would call stray, but Arjun thinks otherwise of it. Character of Akshara is warm and her chemistry with Arjun is refreshing, including their sparing scene which is something to look out for.

This movie is a nice movie on animal safety and protection. Tells us a message taht it is not right to kill animals. This movie is aa fight for animals's survial. In this movie fighting is for a good noble cuase unlike contemporary movies where fight is for vengeance or love. I loved the concept of this story and acting performances of all the stars in the movie. Anshuman Jha and Ridhi Dogra killed it with their performances and even the rest of the star cast. I also loved the love story, romancce concept of this movie. A romance where a wman makes the first move. I loved to watch the expression of love and apporch from a woman perspective in this movie. This movie was a teat to watch as it was something diferent not ordinary but extraordinary. I liked the action sequences aloso in this movie karate type- martial arts type. I loved to watch Ridhi Dogra's character on screeen. Literally felt in love with her expressions and performance skills. Even Mlind oman and Paresh Pahuja. Their perfromances are also extraordinary.

There was a time when encounter specialists deemed themselves judge, jury, and executioner - they'd ruthlessly remove gangsters from the dangerous streets of Mumbai by shooting them dead. The media also hailed them as saviours of the city, because it was easy to do so. Encounters would always make for front page news or shocking headlines, so it was natural for the officers to get a high out of it. When the world became more inquisitive about at least some of these questionable encounters, the saviours turned villains. The morality behind this is what the documentary leaves you to think about.

It covers interviews of major police officers, journalists and ex-D-company person and also shows the impact of shootouts, gang wars, and encounters and also opens old wounds of the Mumbai 1993 riots and the blasts.

This film, let's say film, uses real life characters, pictures, and footages, means there are no actors involved. Yeah, there are 1-2 actors whose job is to recreate the scenes that were not filmed originally at the time. On the other hand, this film does good job in showing the faces of both underworld and police. Actually, the real people involved in real life incidents are brought to the camera and asked for interview to share their point of view, which is a good job because both police officers and ex-gangsters are invited on the camera. You will get to see the perspective of both police and goons in this movie, as well as some journalists. I will rate this movie 7 stars. The movie does not have a conclusion. It started from one point and ended on the other point, but I never got the point that they are trying to show us. What is it? I never got it. What is their sole purpose of making this documentary? I don't understand that bcause we start from 90's and directly jump into 2022. We never got the conclusion of what happened next after the incidents in 90's. They just showed that this police officer did that much encounter and xyz happened. So what? Everybody knows that. I am just rating this movie based on the real footages that they have collected.

With a rope loosely tied about each one's neck, \"Stefan\" (Sebastian Hülk) immediately concludes that this is the work of the indigenous population and starts to take it out on the girl. Her father intervenes only for the farmer to set his dogs on the man. Now rather brutally orphaned, she leaves to seek justice from the mayor (Daniel Muñoz). He proves worse than useless, but the priest suggest she try to find a roof with \"Mateo\" (Daniel Antivilo). It turns out that he is a decent man, surviving on subsistence fishing and well versed in the more mystic arts of their traditions. \"Rosa\" wants to avenge her father's murder and now, more and more absorbed into the \"Brujería\", events in their small village causes consternation for her previous employers as their two sons go missing - just as two young, and fairly docile, cubs arrive! What now ensues sees the Christian community react with a combination of fear and militarism, but will that be sufficient to combat the power of the sorcery that is clearly at work demanding restoration of the equilibrium with both nature and amongst the divided and bigoted people. It's quite slowly paced, and it might have been filmed in the wettest place on the continent, but that works quite well to illustrate the timelessness of a way of life that thrived before the colonists arrived. The symbiotic relationship between people and nature and faith is quite potently, yet delicately, demonstrated by some charming acting and the design of the production looks good and earthy too. It's not your traditional style of horror film - indeed it doesn't really fit into that genre at all, but it's still quite an eerie and creepy exercise in leaving the forces of nature in peace and doing unto others..."},

When her son passes, it becomes even more of a personal journey. Because the inuits were still allowed to hunt seals, there were large protests. And credit to aaju for attending the protest summit in denmark. Trying to educate the public, she explains that this is the only economy and food source available where they live. Aaju is very angry, and cusses freely. It's sometimes hard to watch. They didn't interview the protesters. They didn't interview the ex boyfriend, who she fights with on the cell phone. They don't interview anyone who relocated the inuit children to larger cities to further their education. They didn't interview any of the lawyers they were fighting against. We only hear aaju's side of everything. At sixty seven minutes, they DO have a discussion with someone who explains how and why greenland cultures were absorbed into denmark. And right near the end, she talks about missing indigenous women. What? That came out of left field. It's an interesting story, but not really a documentary. At fifty one minutes, peter summarizes the mission of the film: the problem with cultures being \"being governed by a foreign country\". It's okay. Written and directed by lin alluna and peter.

It lacked originality and failed to capture my attention. The story felt flat and the characters were uninteresting. The cinematography and special effects were nothing memorable and the soundtrack added nothing to the overall experience. The pacing was off and the movie felt drawn-out and slow. The characters seemed one dimensional and lacked any real depth. However, while it may be entertaining in parts, there are far too many cliches and moments of convenient coincidences to make it worth watching. Overall, it was not a waste of time and i did actually enjoyed the movie. As a local from Jeddah, you can appreciate the efforts they did to take you back in the early 2000s."},

The flow of the story is clear and not confusing, and with the beginning of Hamed we see the development of the character step by step. I think that in the middle of the film there was a gap in the course of events, but the situation was rectified. The level of humor is beautiful. Very, I find myself laughing non-stop. The situation comedy is very nice and suits the atmosphere of the movie. The writing is very good and the dialogues are on point. The ending is very satisfactory and fits the story.

Bad acting, horrible writing, use of the same props in different scenes, everyone addressing the star of the movie as \"Ms.\", despite the fact that she is a doctor.

The proceedings are completely engaging (up until the climax), with Bijibal's score, Kiran Das' cuts, and Gautham Sankar's cinematography serving their purposes well. Little revelations lead to bigger ones, and there are facets to Kannan that we get to know in bits and pieces.

Its next to nothing. How can you classify their cinema in the context of good cinema several Malayalam directors having being churning out for the benefits of Malayalees across the world. Gems that can be cherised until your last breath. Let's take a case in point of two exalted directors during the 1980 and late 1990. Adoor Gopalakrishnan and Govindan Aravindan. They made awful movies which had no entertainment value of any kind. They got ill deserved praise and adulation from journalists and juries with adherence to a certain political ideology. I remember watching \"Kanchana Sita\" by G Aravindan, its probably the worst movie I have ever seen in my life. It was meaningless and pointless, a retelling of Ramayana made by the jaundiced eyes of an ultra-left director. It was so comical to watch the movie, in fact Sita is never shown in a movie centred around her. But crticis educated us by saying that her virtual presence is compellingly evoked in the moods of the forest and the elements. How funny. It became evident to me why these people flourished making such crap during the so-called arthouse, new age period of Malayalam cinema."},

Caitlin Duffy is certainly the better of the actors in this film and her performance was the most interesting to watch. Other characters did well but they were flat. The tomorrow job is about three thieves. In this time line there is a drug that lets you travel forward in time and it helps see things that might happen, and they want to steal what the future holds. There's loads of stuff about paradox's and what not and overall it was easy to follow, thoug confusing at times witg good and bad acting. But an interesting enough plot to make it entertaining."},

This is all in spite of the gang leader's carefully constructed scenarios to prevent such paradoxes and time loops. The gang come under attack by operatives who apparently come from decades in the future. The mechanics of the time travel is well handled and the drug has a backstory.

It's a good thing these are short, I almost turned it off after the second story and even relatively better ones dont seem good enough to stand alone. The best part is the fake advertisements and style touches between stories. In an example of bad, one story has a twist that appears the fellow is just wearing an obvious rubber mask.

Neither are very keen on this arrangement but patrimonial loyalty and all that... An early shoulder massage illustrates really early on that these two are not a marriage made in heaven. Indeed, she proves considerably more adept than him at just about everything and is also unafraid of speaking her mind in front of his nobles - and women, well that just wasn't done! What now ensues does have an element of predictability to it, but this period of 16th century Japanese history is fraught with intrigues, political machinations, duplicity and ambition - and over the next 2¾ hours we have a decently paced unravelling of a generation of dynastic ambitions and manoeuvring that looks good and holds the attention well. Ayase takes the acting plaudits - she delivers well; and the others contribute adequately as the story advances. For me, it was the focus on the internecine society of love and honour your lord whilst you figure out ways to stab him in the back that worked well here. Loads of CGI - well it is 2023, after all, but the costumier and armourer's arts are well represented and the combat scenes spare us the worst excesses of repetition. It's a long slot of your day to commit to on the television, and I wonder if it would look better on a cinema screen, but if it's a genre in which you've an interest, then this is well worth a watch."},

Aya Ueto's portrayal exudes unwavering strength, while Takuya Kimura's character evolves from hesitation to determined success and ultimately to a supremely confident ruler.

This young man was and is Frank Isaac \"Sugar Chile\" Robinson, born 12/28/1938, and is still alive.

And, when it comes to designating who truly is the king of rock 'roll, this documentary from director Lisa Cortes does just that. Richard Wayne Penniman - professionally known as Little Richard (1932-2020) - burst onto the pop music scene in the mid-1950s with a singular, unrestrained, high-energy style that set him apart from other aspiring performers at the time, achieving tremendous success with hits like \"Tutti Fruitti\" and \"Long Tall Sally,\" among others. However, even though he developed a strong following and a reputation for chart-busting releases, he never quite attained the widespread notoriety of others, like Elvis Presley and Pat Boone, particularly when they covered his hits. He also didn't achieve the financial success that he deserved, thanks to record labels that gave him raw deals. What's more, as a flamboyant, openly gay Black musician at a time when those qualities were far from well tolerated, he became a target for ostracism and scorn from conservative circles, whose leaders spouted inflammatory claims that he was undermining the moral fabric of traditional American culture with his \"decadent\" music and \"perverted\" lifestyle. Yet his blend of colorful performances, mixed with outlandish costumes, pancake makeup and frenetic stage antics and backed by tunes that fused boogie woogie, rhythm & blues and gospel, made him a standout, a style that countless artists drew from - and openly acknowledged his influence - when they emerged in their own right, many of whom are interviewed in the film in archive footage or recent conversations. The result here is a revelatory examination of someone who set a standard but who never received the degree of recognition he merited until many years after his debut on the music scene. \"Little Richard: I Am Everything\" features a wealth of historical footage, including many interviews with the artist himself, along with observations from the likes of Mick Jagger, Billy Porter, Paul McCartney, Tom Jones, Nona Hendryx and superfan filmmaker John Watters, as well as an array of music industry, African-American and gay community historians. Viewers are likely to come away from this offering knowing a lot about Little Richard that they hadn't known previously, enabling them to gain a new appreciation for the rock icon and learning much about the many triumphs and challenges he faced during his colorfully enigmatic life. Audiences are sure to come away from this one proclaiming \"Long live rock - and the king who finally gets to wear his much-deserved crown.\""},

Gaining fans from the unlikeliest of places; England (in the form of the Beatles & Stones) Richard was soon on his way musically but his own personal demons; being gay & non-secular at the same time would dog him for the rest of his career sometimes where he'd renounce his sexuality for the church & vice versa but his real annoyance came in the form of not being recognized for his sizable, quantifiable influence on rock music (witness the montage of artists he influenced w/Harry Styles himself wearing gender bending clothes appealing to the masses) which was hopefully rectified by the end of his life.

Unfortunately, LR: I Am Everything is a patchy chronicle of Richard's life and his manic swings between sexually-liberated rock-n-roller and homophobic fire-and-brimstone god botherer. In the end Lisa Cortes clumsily answers the question \"Who was Little Richard?\" by lamely accepting he was both of these extremes and that this was somehow okay. Except it wasn't okay because LR clearly had a tortured existence, traumatised by religion, constantly at war with himself. The pain is etched in his face through many of the interviews featured here, and his wildest, most outrageous behaviour suggests someone who was mentally unstable, if not suffering from some undiagnosed illness. The way he was variously exploited, discarded and celebrated by the music industry also cries out for a more nuanced and forensic examination. In the end, attempting to make this a celebration of Little Richard felt bizarrely discordant and wrong. Little Richard's life was a rolling tragedy. He never attained any peace (despite what his religious followers will claim). And his musical output was meagre because of the pain and exploitation he endured.

In this film it looks like Gandhi ji is giving explanation for all the disastrous decisions he took before and after the Independence. This film has nothing to do with the history. I will suggest you not to waste your time on this film, and yes if you wanna watch it then just watch it as a fictional drama that has nothing to do with reality. This movie is similar to Tide(washing powder) advertisement , It just tries to clean the image of Gandhi ji. If we talk about Godse, he is just portrayed as a villain who realises his mistake at the end of the film and accepted Gandhi ji and his ideology . This film just tries to balance things that happened in our past which makes no sense."},

Very sad to see only few screens were given to this movie with most preferring Pathan over this. Had there been a big actor this movie would have been a blockbuster only word of mouth which I am sure will be great should save the film provided it gets enough screen space. Acting was top notch.

The overall impression which you get after watching is that godse was an immature guy who only believed in hindu rashtra ideology and out of sheer anger he tried to kill gandhi. But what about his speech which he gives in the court... What about the background and reasoning of him trying to kill gandhi... None of it has been shown. This is 2023 and there is a lot of information floating around.... I would definitely suggest the director that if this is the level of presentation u think people are expecting.,then you seriously need to work on your craft. Rather than this fictional tale where godse saves gandhi in the end and they both come out as a friend, had the director shown what actually happened, it would have gone far better. The movie may show the facts but the emotional impact which it creates is the valorisation of gandhi's ideology....."},

And this film, an 'after-hours' dissection offers a fresh look at history that is mildly thought provoking yet surprisingly light-headed and entertaining. It does leave you with questions, answers, and some more things to reflect upon. As someone who comes from both the schools of thought through lineage, I chuckled at how accurate some depictions were- of believers, of naysayers and of followers who choose to follow for no particular or sound basis/reason. Rajkumar Santoshi and team have given us a film that feels fresh in its devices, the lightness of touching narratives set in stone through decades. AR Rahman's score gave me chills at many places. Goes without saying that man understand cinema, emotions, dialog and poignance of it all like a master. The use of silences and mellow instruments like a flute here a pipe there and the symphonic touches are just other-worldly and underline the film's honest storytelling. Vaishnav Jan To sequence, the opening credits, the end credits suite(Raghupati Raghav) and Godse theme are all Rahman gems from his endless vault of magic."},

The story follows two parallel yet opposing protagonists, one a world leading marine geologist, the other a CEO of a mining company.

David Garber (\"Sgt. Alexander\") and Michael Southworth (\"Sgt. Reese\") are charged with leading a secret CIA mission whilst facing opposition from their tenacious enemy and, as the two men come to terms with their own sexuality, with their colleague's attitude to that - all whilst under fire and in hostile terrain. The narrative here is all over the place. The lacklustre direction and soporific score; the really mediocre writing and the stilted acting all contribute to what is essentially a throughly unremarkable piece of cinema that seems to have no idea who it is for, or what it is trying to say - beyond the bleeding (quite literally) obvious. Most films from this theatre of war depict tragedy and brutality - but most do it far more cogently than this insipid melodrama that uses a gay angle to the story to thinly disguise a poor piece of wartime story-telling. It can't have had much of a budget and much of it looks like it was filmed in someone's back yard. It probably was, and maybe they could just stick to showing it there, too. Very poor."},

It is a heartfelt representation of probably 1,000's of soldiers who were not only coming of age as men, (the average age of Vietnam soldiers was 19) but finding their own sexual identity. With the backdrop of an increasingly senseless and unwinnable war, the film captures the heartbreaking consequences of love in the midst of volatile uncertainty.

The cinematography, acting and script were all good. I didn't find the openness of the gay love story credible, but it didn't matter. The theme of acceptance under harsh conditions and the sheer power of love are fundamental to the human psyche. We didn't get to see how the two gay soldiers formed an unbreakable, romantic bond, under such unlikely circumstances. Instead we are introduced to their characters after their relationship has already evolved. So we don't get any insights into how they were able to overcome social and military stigmas around gay men. One of my favorite scenes was when the helicopters rescued them. The script, the acting...the emotional pain and responses all resonated with realness."},

I felt he really gave you an inside look at the mindset of someone in that position during that horrible time. The only real cons of the movie were the special effects like the bullets and the explosions, you could definitely tell they were CGI, but this is expected due to the low budget on the film. I would have like to have seen more aerial fighting as well with the choppers using their weapons against the enemy during the transporting of the soldiers during the battle.

{"movie_id": "tt18554676", "reviewer_name": "Giuseppe_Silecchia", "review_date": "Apr 20, 2024", "review_score": "5", "review_text": "I Migliori Giorni, the new anthology film directed by Edoardo Leo and Massimiliano Bruno, presents itself as an unflinching mirror reflecting the harsh reality of human connections during the holidays. Despite the promising cast of well-known actors, the final result falls somewhere between bittersweet comedy and a depiction of everyday hypocrisies. In this mosaic of four episodes, the film explores family, social, and romantic dynamics, focusing on Christmas, New Year's Eve, Valentine's Day, and International Women's Day. While the stories are well-written, they sometimes lack the depth needed to leave a lasting impact. The first episode, centered around family divisions regarding vaccination, offers a sharp and timely glimpse into society. However, the tone falters towards the end, missing the opportunity to further delve into the raised issues. The second episode, which delves into the hypocrisy of an entrepreneur seeking moral redemption, presents an intriguing premise but loses itself in a plot without a meaningful conclusion. The third episode, set on Valentine's Day, attempts to explore polyamory and fidelity but ends up falling into clichés and predictable situations. Finally, the last episode, focused on International Women's Day and the condemnation of misogynistic TV programming, offers a positive note, but even here, the ending feels overly optimistic, missing the chance to delve deeper into the raised themes. The film's strength lies in the performances of the actors, particularly in the trio of siblings played by Edoardo Leo, Anna Foglietta, and Massimiliano Bruno. Their chemistry and authenticity bring a touch of humanity to the stories, although at times the dialogue feels overly dramatic. The direction by Leo and Bruno, while competent, shows some uncertainties in handling the endings of the episodes, which tend to deflate rather than conclude decisively. The soundtrack effectively underscores the different atmospheres but at times feels intrusive, overshadowing the actors' performances. I Migliori Giorni offers an interesting and at times touching glimpse into human nature, but the final result fails to shine as one might expect from such a talented cast. The film may be enjoyable for the general audience, but it leaves a slight sense of dissatisfaction for those expecting a deeper reflection on current social dynamics."},

And yes, up until now, I don't remember seeing him in anything other than (lower grade) B-rate material. (Disclaimer: myself being a connoisseur of SyFy originals AND/OR not liking the very mentioned A. Schwartzenegger either, or, say, S. Stallone having some roles he doesn't want you to know). But who cares about it as long as this particular film is perfectly watchable and enjoyable in the finest spaghetti western tradition. I can't find any obvious flaws with its direction, acting, dialogue, music, camera work, etc. Everything looks solid, and the film being rather short, is a plus in my view, as I am SO tired fast forwarding through 3-hour dribble so common these days. Can't wait for the sequel."},

What can I say about the work of Alexander and director Joe Cornet, the film is really not bad and you don't want to turn it off after 10 minutes. The secondary characters are interesting, but it would be cool to reveal more of their stories/backstories. The fact that the main character is based on a historical figure is very cool.

From the outset, the script feels poorly constructed, with clunky dialogue and a storyline that lacks any real engagement or originality. The directing fails to bring any nuance or depth to the material, leaving the actors struggling to make something out of nothing. Even the usually talented cast seems lost, with performances that come across as flat and uninspired. The production design and cinematography are unbelievably subpar, lacking any creativity or visual appeal. It's baffling how someone as talented as Bob Odenkirk ended up in a project like this. Perhaps it seemed promising on paper or was a result of contractual obligations, but it's hard to reconcile his involvement with the overall quality of the film.

The film's strength lies in its ability to balance the harsh realities of Ichemrahen's past with the enchanting world of haute pâtisserie. The scenes in the kitchen are a feast for the eyes, filled with exquisite desserts and the intense pressure of competition. The performances are solid, particularly from Riadh Belaïche, who portrays Ichemrahen with a compelling blend of vulnerability and fierce determination. The narrative is often predictable, following a well-trodden path of underdog success stories, but it's executed with sincerity and charm.

The first 30 minutes were the roughest to get through, but eventually it rolls into its basic premise with a plot device spotted a mile away. The acting was OK, but not always convincing. Truthfully, a little above what I was expecting for this lower budget category. It tries to be clever with surreal story effects (dreams, I guess) but doesn't really land. For its budget, the sound design and audio are good, however, it would have scored better with me if it wasn't for the over-used camera/editing gimmicks. Dark filters, blur filters, bouncy/shaky cam, and even in this case, upside-down scenes, which in my opinion, worked against it and became distracting if not annoying. It is not completely void of intensity or good shots, so it did have its moments. No, Bianca does not do the splits and clobber opponents in the groin with a banshee wail, but she does rough it up, in more ways than one, even if upside-down."},

The movie features the story of a wedding singer, who sings \"taverna muzigi\" (tavern music) in a pianist (or keyboard player) singer-songwriter style in 1980's. This style, which the singers often sang songs of personal troubles, impossible-loves, love-sickness, sadness, and tragedies, was famous in that era. Ata Demirer, known for his sincere comedies, drifts from this style and moves to a different style, which has lots of famous examples, in which real singers had sung and played in movies of that era. However this movie falls beyond expectations, with lots of poor acting (except Özge Özacar) and and fragmented narratives. The movie can be said to be mediocre, except amazing songs made and sang by Ata Demirer himself."},

Probably because we're accustomed to his higher performances, it was an extremely disappointing experience for me.

But when you keep watching that it tells us a quite in a unique and effective way that ain't drops attention of the viewers . I strongly reccomended you to watch this movie , i try to avoid the not giving spoilers soo the viewer might get fresh and great experience with it . Thanks Ata Demirel for this wonderful movie , i must admit that for his previous movie experiences i just thought that this movies is kind of one of it's smilar and kinda ok movies , but in this movie really his best movie .

I watched his movies and stand up show many times. He is a perfect talent. In my first review I said I didn't like the movie because it is not a comedy and I didn't laugh at all but I misjudged the movie, this is a musical drama and when I think like that, I can say Ata Demirer executes perfect job. It is so naive with lots of details and also very well observed of period... Also it has a deep story about being looser or I don't know unlucky maybe.. I really loved it. Also I loved the woman singer voice so much,very arabesque.. I hope we can see second movie with happy final. Good characterizations, nice scenes and lovely 80s atmosphere... Really Good job.

The plot had me hooked with all its twists and turns. Brittany S. Hall did a great job, and the action scenes were pretty cool. The story kept me interested, and the production quality was solid for a streaming movie. Definitely give it a watch if you like action-packed thrillers."},

The fight scenes were not Jason Statham level, but they were good. The plot was cohesive and made sense. The acting was not the greatest, but it was not so bad that it made the movie unwatchable nor did it distract from the pacing so much that it inhibited enjoyment. All in all, i give it a solid 6 stars."},

Hadn't ever heard of it before but after watching the trailer, I decided to tune in and I must say that I was pleasantly surprised considering I had already watched three films that were a bit mediocre. This one had an excellent plot and storyline, the fight scenes were not bad considering and the actors did really well and it didn't look low budget as I have been accustomed to as of late so I am giving it a 10 out of 10 not to say that it was perfect but to balance out some of the other reviews that just seem absolutely ridiculously low for no reason because this actually was a good quality film. Kudos to all parties involved."},

I thought the movie was well done. If you had a problem following the storyline, that's a reflection on you. I personally enjoy movies with lots of twists and turns. Keeps me on my toes. The actors did a great job. Brittney Hall (Imani) was stellar and by far the best role I've seen her in. Demetrius Shipp Jr. Also did a good job. Im hoping there is a part 2 coming. It's rare to have an action movie with a majority black cast and with it being Black History Month, I was pleasantly surprised. Kudos and looking forward to the second installment of \"Imani\"."},

Said so much about how we abuse others less powerful than USA and corruption of politicians. Too many innocent people die to benefit a handful of corrupt, rich and powerful. This is not new it's the history of America. Nevertheless it was entertaining as well. I'm pretty good at figuring out who all the bad guys are, but there were some surprises. Would definitely see part 2 if ever there is one. Interesting ending. Not really sure who or why this was done, which is why a part 2 would be great. 34 characters to go! 12 more characters to go!"},

From the beginning to the end I was intrigued and could not miss a second of it because each character was important and had vital information that moved the story forward. That is good because if I am able to go away and come back and not be confused that means i didn't miss anything important, but this movie you would. There wasn't one character there that did not have an importance in the movie. The pace was at the right speed and I was able to follow along the action and drama."},

So I was a bit surprised by the vote (before I watched it) and by the movie itself I'd say. There are decent jump scares and shocks throughout. The story also kind of works - plus there is that very strong beginning ... unfortunately that can also be seen a bit as a downfall of the movie too."},

Set in WWII in the Philippines, the father has some gold hidden, which the Japanese soldiers want, so there are perhaps more gracious to the family. One day the father leaves to find the Americans, and says he will be back soon. Behind is the mother, who is sick, her daughter Tala and son Bayani and a servant. After a number of days, Tala and Bayani set out into the forest to find father. Tala comes upon this shelter, and enters. A fairy appears, saying that only one who is truly innocent could find and enter, and she can provide wishes. To cure the mother, she gives Tala a jar with an insect inside. As the mother gets worse, one night Tala sets the insect on her mother, and it crawls inside her. Well, think along the lines of the monkey paw as to what happens. There is always a catch. The movie is well done, just slow, and it also has a lot of mood, which fits."},

Kenneth Dagatan crafts a chilling narrative set against the backdrop of World War II, a time already ripe with despair and fear. What makes this film stand out is its ability to weave horror into the fabric of historical trauma while maintaining a fairy tale-like atmosphere that feels unsettlingly magical."},
