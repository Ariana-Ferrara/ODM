Two sisters, very close, then one of them gets engaged to be married, which leaves the younger sister feeling a little deserted. So far, so normal. You can immediately see how the plot will develop. Younger sister tries to break up the couple, falls out with older sister, but then has an epiphany and discovers her future brother in law is a wonderful person and everyone hugs and lives happily ever after. Deception that's not what happens. It kind of does for a while, but gets progressively more and more surreal. Many will watch this movie and think it went totally off the rails. But I just found myself laughing - partly because it was, yes, silly, but mainly because it was fun. And we didn't really need another predictable \"boy meets girl and other girl/boy gets upset\" movie, did we?"},

If you have ever wondered what it might look like if Quentin Tarantino consulted on a modernized Pakistani version of Jane Austen ... well, writer-director Nida Manzoor shows us (with no actual assistance from QT), including stylized martial arts, class warfare, and an obsession with a stuntwoman career. It's Ms. Manzoor's first feature film (she created the TV series \"We are Lady Parts\") and she presents an extremely creative film with a balance of silly and dark themes that proves immensely entertaining."},

I get what they are trying to do but it ends up cliched, predictable and silly beyond what I was willing to accept because of poor execution.

The lead is good and supported by two actors as her friends that add good comedic value. The rest of the cast is fine nothing special. But they all deserved better."},

Working Title Films, the production company, has a fine record in comedy and action films such as 4 Weddings to which I couldn't help comparing this while I watched it. But the clunkiest line in that rom-com (\"Is it raining? I hadn't noticed\") is Wildean compared to the best here. The lead character, Ria Khan (Priya Kansara) repeats the trailer's echoed line \"I am the fury\" on numerous occasions, none of them funny or effective. Strangely, her character - well educated in a private school - seems to think that training to enter her desired career in movie stunts requires nothing apart from learning one martial art."},

Priya Kansara and Ritu Arya play sisters that treat life with unorthodox flair. It took a few scenes to realize these girls had questionable decision-making abilities. A few scenes after that, there's a kung fu fight between Ria (Priya) and a school bully. From that point on, you know this movie doesn't take itself seriously. It's funny throughout, and they build on prior jokes with masterful precision. I had no expectations going in and came out a winner. This movie will make you smile. I've seen it a couple more times since, and each time I find something else that I missed the first time around. The plot is good, the soundtrack is great and acting, superb. Better than a \"Marvel or a Star War\"."},

The sisters (played by Priya Kansara and Ritu Arya) are total showstealers and I enjoyed both their performances. People aren't wrong in saying Polite Society looks straight out of Edgar Wright's playbook - it features rich and opaque frames, the presence of absurd humour (there's an entire fight scene between the sisters in the house, and none of the wounds from it show in the subsequent scenes), quirky edits & slo-mos, some flashy typeface, and the effective use of music - the only thing missing was a Simon Pegg cameo."},

Her characters are wonderfully engaging, demanding that you root for them. I enjoyed every minute of watching these women embrace their power. Hollywood take note: female audiences are hungry for more unapologetically strong, opinionated women. I only wish more female directors of color had opportunities to tell their stories. What a far more interesting place the world would be. I also loved the soundtrack. You can tell that Manzoor loves music the way she mixes genres to emphasize the story. What a great use of the X-ray Spex song \"Identity.\""},

That involves his sexually ambiguous and brutal brother \"Cuco\" (Beau Knapp) who decides, quite cleverly, that he will kidnap the daughter of \"Doc\" and force him to do their dirty work for them... What now ensues is just poor, sorry. It's like a video-shoot 'em up game with bodies falling all over the place and little if any jeopardy until the last few minutes when, even then, the ending has precious little by way of surprise. The plot itself is pretty preposterous and the acting does little to inject any real sense of menace to this procedural, repetitive and over-long training video for would-be ten year old assassins. I wouldn't bother if I were you."},

He gets a bit of a shock, though, when his new boss sends him back to the benches where he must, again, actually practice law. It's here, after a night on the booze, that he turns up to defend a woman charged with the negligent homicide of her young son. A combination of his laziness, incompetence and his hangover leaves this woman hung out to dry when one of the witnesses - from whom he didn't get a written deposition - changes his story. Off to jail she goes and into a maelstrom of despair goes he before the guilt starts to kick in, and he decides to get his act together. His co-defending counsel \"Evelyn\" from the original trial (Renci Yeung) and he decide to try and convince the convicted \"Jolene\" (Louise Wong) to let them work on an appeal and the remainder of this rather flat courtroom drama follows their efforts. It starts off quite entertainingly, with a bit of a tetchy dynamic between the lawyers and to be fair, Dayo Wong is quite proficient as the bored and rather indolent lawyer. Sadly, though, once the ship is all upright again, the story becomes one of rather predicable family intrigue and power-broking that exposes us to many from a supporting cast that are as unremarkable as the dialogue. The photography has something of a television feature to it and the denouement, though quite lively paced - well you can see that coming from space. At 2¼ hours it is also far too long with just not enough meat on the story to sustain it. Perhaps a more judiciously cut edit and a few fewer side-stories might have made it more of a watchable \"Perry Mason\" style drama, but as it is - I was a bit bored by the end."},

What hooks audience is the anticipation to see how those moneyed, callous bastards to be vanquished despite of their insuperable privileges, and Ng's film doesn't disappoint in this regard, in particular when the senior prosecutor (Tse Kwan-Ho, inimitably august and inscrutably righteous) shifts his ground and lays into the culprit, although juridically speaking, some of the elocution smacks of fanfaronade, tailored to create some semblance of a rousing contentment which has been deployed ad nauseam in similar situations, at the end of the day, justice must prevails, and audience feel good about it.

I enjoy Dayo Wong shows for his comedy and integrity, but he was kind of overacted when it comes to movies, which needs to be a bit more subtle and down to earth to meet with the reality, but in spite with all the flaws he does kind of carry through with the character. The most important part of the movie is the message it conveys, which is common sense, justice, truth, human rights and humanity, things that the courts in Hong Kong has certainly lost in recent years. The judicial system is totally bent to meet political propaganda rather than justice and truth and a total disregard of human rights. This movie is a good call for the countless cases of wrongly accused for the protestors and legislators in recent years, which were unjustly convicted with over extended periods of jail time, yet these ugly judges and attorney generals have no shame in putting out these unfair trails and sentences in collusion with the political propaganda. There's a great message in the movie : \"ARE YOU EVEN HUMAN BEING?\" is a great reflection of these scumbags."},

It picked up the pace after half an hour or so. The.plot of movie may probably be repetitive, therefore a bit monotonous. However, the screenplay and the quirky comedies and the situational hilarity rendered it to be a good entertainment. It does indeed clock above average in terms of entertainment quotient unlike most Malayalam movies which are quite very deeply serious affairs."},

Situational comedies in the movie are the best that have been seen in recent movies. But it was quite relaxing to watch this amidst of current dark themed movies running. The movie is intended for malayalees only so that other natives would not find the movie a good one. The movie is focused on comedy and entertainment rather than a serious or realistic movie."},

So many perspectives on coal are black and white -- this one explores the complex and historical relationship with coal of the people who live and work with it. It does not demonize coal or coal miners, nor does it whitewash the devastating effects of the industry on the land and people. For once Appalachians are portrayed in a nuanced, compassionate way, and with the perspective provided you come to understand how and why coal has helped and hindered Appalachia. It took me several days to conclude what I had been trying to figure out:\nThis film is art, not just a simple documentary. It braves the risk of presenting a story within the story, focusing on a child and how she grows up with the complicated realities of her region. The stunning visuals made me eager for others to see past the stereotypes into the beauty that is this sacred place. Well done, Ms. Sheldon."},

Many people agree that America needs new stories to live by. The story we lived by in Appalachia for a century expired twenty years ago, so Appalachia has wisdom to share. King Coal is an extraordinary elegy for the \"King\" in the title. Then the film goes farther and nudges us to consider ways to move forward that are not dystopia or fantasy. What I love most about the film is how Sheldon shows us that the resources we need for the future are ones we in Appalachia have had all along: unity, ingenuity, resilience, community, integrity, imagination, and above all, humanity.

If that means a girl rents a house, then I guess it's correct. But I'm guessing the film-makers wanted to imply that the supernatural elements which befall her are the part which is supposed to be real. I guess if you make it until the end you'll realise which parts were supposed to be 'real' and which weren't. Um, that's pretty much a summary of the movie. A girl - Julia Fields, would you believe! - moved into a rented house in Florida where she's slowly stalked by more and more supernatural events and entities."},

It wasn't bad but it wasn't good..The story is a true story so they could have really took this to another level and built some substance. The main actress' acting was robotic and almost cringe. I couldn't get lost in the movie because they weren't selling me on their roles. It was obvious they are actors. Bless their hearts they tried... it could have been scarier but kinda felt like a fever dream instead. There were a few creepy parts though. I think they could have added scarier music to make you feel unease and get your adrenaline pumping. The end is really rushed and there is no build up. It just kinda wraps up where you are left wondering what just happened and you're wanting more substance and detail."},

Whether you're already a fan of one of the series or both, there's a very good chance you'll thoroughly enjoy this movie. All the characters are present and accounted for, retaining their signature humor and penchant for crazy action, and they interact in a way that really clicks. Lupin does seem to carry a significant portion of the exposition, but the film also provides some heartfelt and eagerly anticipated expansions to the lore surrounding the Cats characters. The action sequences are wonderfully directed, and if you happen to have a 5.1 surround sound system at your disposal, the combination of cinematic mayhem and jazzy music will provide an incredibly immersive and powerful audio experience."},

I grew up with both shows in the 80s, and I worshipped Cat's Eye, read all the manga, watched all the anime. So when I saw this title on Amazon Prime, I was excited to watch it. But what a disappointment it was. The anime style and character design is so bad and amateur that not only it was distracting, I actually started getting a headache from watching the whole 93 minutes of the movie. The story premise had potential, but it became more stupid as the minutes went by. I could see the plot twist pretty much the minute the character involved in the twist showed up at the beginning of the movie. Whoever wrote the story completely butchered the beloved characters - Lupin was never charming or likable, even after they tried giving him a heart of gold. He just seemed like a total a-hole. The Kisugi sisters (the Cat's Eye trio) were so naive and dumb, not at all cunning and smart like they were in the manga or anime. Even their action scenes came off as cheap acrobat tricks, no elegance or grace. The villains were completely laughable, and all the supporting characters are boring and forgettable, even Fujiko was lame. It's almost like the writer(s) has never studied the original works that this movie was based on. What a shame that a new generation of viewers were introduced to these amazing characters in such an awful way. I highly recommend skipping this lame-fest and watch the original animes from the 80s/90s instead."},

Not to mention the relationship between Lupin and AI was very touching and sibling-like. Only downside would be the villains but it was a minor nitpick and the rest of the characters more than made up for it.

The whole film drags and moves forward so slowly at snail's pace. The plot is not interesting at all and is just a routine hero against corrupt organisation thing, with that same old social message stuff, that we have seen countless number of times before. And even after keeping all things considered, it doesn't even manages to entertain as well - which was it's main job. The whole setup, camera work, dialogues, cinematography and the action feels so outdated. Even the performances by the leads were not appropriate, it seemed they aren't interested in this film too. And direction is very weak. Overall Kranti is a train wreck and I won't recommend this at all."},

One side we see new talents making some extraordinary movies which gets success allover India & global appreciation. On the other side senior star actors with high budget are making some trash. Kranti as the name says revolution & it's a revolution in education field... Private school mafia their fee structure, donation and how they loot poor. But this kind of story has been tried and tested n no.of times so nothing new. Darshan again picks the same story and adds nothing new to it... Yuvarathna did the same mistake. Nobody gives a solution they just showcase the loopholes which is known to every citizen. Harikrishna should stop direction coz it's not his cup of tea. No doubt he is a good music director & should concentrate more on music. Harikrishna is still in Yajamana hangover where he show cooking oil mafia exploiting farmers. Here it's education private schools. First half of the movie lags alot coz of slow screenplay, Darshan is repeating the same mistake again n again same kind of dialogue delivery, non-synchronised stunts, poor VFX literally makes the viewer laugh. He should come out of his comfort zone and experiment new stories. Same old mass masala where whole movie is hero based self centred story doesn't work. May be his fans will like whatever he does but there should be some limit. If it gets repeated Darshan's film career will be on stake nothing else."},

The built-in English subtitles were horribly translated, too small, and on screen for only a second or so, thus the dialogue was hard to follow. If you're out of action films to watch, I'd say give this one a go if you're bored, it's only a brisk 80 min viewing, although you may have to rewind a bunch of times to try and make out the subtitles."},

The film has interesting action sequences and Arjun, played by Anshuman Jha has caught the nuances of classic hand-to-hand combat with finesse. Apart from the action, the story revolves around Arjun, his love for animals and till what extend he can go to protect the helpless animals. Which most Indians would call stray, but Arjun thinks otherwise of it. Character of Akshara is warm and her chemistry with Arjun is refreshing, including their sparing scene which is something to look out for.

This movie is a nice movie on animal safety and protection. Tells us a message taht it is not right to kill animals. This movie is aa fight for animals's survial. In this movie fighting is for a good noble cuase unlike contemporary movies where fight is for vengeance or love. I loved the concept of this story and acting performances of all the stars in the movie. Anshuman Jha and Ridhi Dogra killed it with their performances and even the rest of the star cast. I also loved the love story, romancce concept of this movie. A romance where a wman makes the first move. I loved to watch the expression of love and apporch from a woman perspective in this movie. This movie was a teat to watch as it was something diferent not ordinary but extraordinary. I liked the action sequences aloso in this movie karate type- martial arts type. I loved to watch Ridhi Dogra's character on screeen. Literally felt in love with her expressions and performance skills. Even Mlind oman and Paresh Pahuja. Their perfromances are also extraordinary.

There was a time when encounter specialists deemed themselves judge, jury, and executioner - they'd ruthlessly remove gangsters from the dangerous streets of Mumbai by shooting them dead. The media also hailed them as saviours of the city, because it was easy to do so. Encounters would always make for front page news or shocking headlines, so it was natural for the officers to get a high out of it. When the world became more inquisitive about at least some of these questionable encounters, the saviours turned villains. The morality behind this is what the documentary leaves you to think about.

It covers interviews of major police officers, journalists and ex-D-company person and also shows the impact of shootouts, gang wars, and encounters and also opens old wounds of the Mumbai 1993 riots and the blasts.

This film, let's say film, uses real life characters, pictures, and footages, means there are no actors involved. Yeah, there are 1-2 actors whose job is to recreate the scenes that were not filmed originally at the time. On the other hand, this film does good job in showing the faces of both underworld and police. Actually, the real people involved in real life incidents are brought to the camera and asked for interview to share their point of view, which is a good job because both police officers and ex-gangsters are invited on the camera. You will get to see the perspective of both police and goons in this movie, as well as some journalists. I will rate this movie 7 stars. The movie does not have a conclusion. It started from one point and ended on the other point, but I never got the point that they are trying to show us. What is it? I never got it. What is their sole purpose of making this documentary? I don't understand that bcause we start from 90's and directly jump into 2022. We never got the conclusion of what happened next after the incidents in 90's. They just showed that this police officer did that much encounter and xyz happened. So what? Everybody knows that. I am just rating this movie based on the real footages that they have collected.

With a rope loosely tied about each one's neck, \"Stefan\" (Sebastian Hülk) immediately concludes that this is the work of the indigenous population and starts to take it out on the girl. Her father intervenes only for the farmer to set his dogs on the man. Now rather brutally orphaned, she leaves to seek justice from the mayor (Daniel Muñoz). He proves worse than useless, but the priest suggest she try to find a roof with \"Mateo\" (Daniel Antivilo). It turns out that he is a decent man, surviving on subsistence fishing and well versed in the more mystic arts of their traditions. \"Rosa\" wants to avenge her father's murder and now, more and more absorbed into the \"Brujería\", events in their small village causes consternation for her previous employers as their two sons go missing - just as two young, and fairly docile, cubs arrive! What now ensues sees the Christian community react with a combination of fear and militarism, but will that be sufficient to combat the power of the sorcery that is clearly at work demanding restoration of the equilibrium with both nature and amongst the divided and bigoted people. It's quite slowly paced, and it might have been filmed in the wettest place on the continent, but that works quite well to illustrate the timelessness of a way of life that thrived before the colonists arrived. The symbiotic relationship between people and nature and faith is quite potently, yet delicately, demonstrated by some charming acting and the design of the production looks good and earthy too. It's not your traditional style of horror film - indeed it doesn't really fit into that genre at all, but it's still quite an eerie and creepy exercise in leaving the forces of nature in peace and doing unto others..."},

When her son passes, it becomes even more of a personal journey. Because the inuits were still allowed to hunt seals, there were large protests. And credit to aaju for attending the protest summit in denmark. Trying to educate the public, she explains that this is the only economy and food source available where they live. Aaju is very angry, and cusses freely. It's sometimes hard to watch. They didn't interview the protesters. They didn't interview the ex boyfriend, who she fights with on the cell phone. They don't interview anyone who relocated the inuit children to larger cities to further their education. They didn't interview any of the lawyers they were fighting against. We only hear aaju's side of everything. At sixty seven minutes, they DO have a discussion with someone who explains how and why greenland cultures were absorbed into denmark. And right near the end, she talks about missing indigenous women. What? That came out of left field. It's an interesting story, but not really a documentary. At fifty one minutes, peter summarizes the mission of the film: the problem with cultures being \"being governed by a foreign country\". It's okay. Written and directed by lin alluna and peter.

It lacked originality and failed to capture my attention. The story felt flat and the characters were uninteresting. The cinematography and special effects were nothing memorable and the soundtrack added nothing to the overall experience. The pacing was off and the movie felt drawn-out and slow. The characters seemed one dimensional and lacked any real depth. However, while it may be entertaining in parts, there are far too many cliches and moments of convenient coincidences to make it worth watching. Overall, it was not a waste of time and i did actually enjoyed the movie. As a local from Jeddah, you can appreciate the efforts they did to take you back in the early 2000s."},

The flow of the story is clear and not confusing, and with the beginning of Hamed we see the development of the character step by step. I think that in the middle of the film there was a gap in the course of events, but the situation was rectified. The level of humor is beautiful. Very, I find myself laughing non-stop. The situation comedy is very nice and suits the atmosphere of the movie. The writing is very good and the dialogues are on point. The ending is very satisfactory and fits the story.

Bad acting, horrible writing, use of the same props in different scenes, everyone addressing the star of the movie as \"Ms.\", despite the fact that she is a doctor.

The proceedings are completely engaging (up until the climax), with Bijibal's score, Kiran Das' cuts, and Gautham Sankar's cinematography serving their purposes well. Little revelations lead to bigger ones, and there are facets to Kannan that we get to know in bits and pieces.

Its next to nothing. How can you classify their cinema in the context of good cinema several Malayalam directors having being churning out for the benefits of Malayalees across the world. Gems that can be cherised until your last breath. Let's take a case in point of two exalted directors during the 1980 and late 1990. Adoor Gopalakrishnan and Govindan Aravindan. They made awful movies which had no entertainment value of any kind. They got ill deserved praise and adulation from journalists and juries with adherence to a certain political ideology. I remember watching \"Kanchana Sita\" by G Aravindan, its probably the worst movie I have ever seen in my life. It was meaningless and pointless, a retelling of Ramayana made by the jaundiced eyes of an ultra-left director. It was so comical to watch the movie, in fact Sita is never shown in a movie centred around her. But crticis educated us by saying that her virtual presence is compellingly evoked in the moods of the forest and the elements. How funny. It became evident to me why these people flourished making such crap during the so-called arthouse, new age period of Malayalam cinema."},

Caitlin Duffy is certainly the better of the actors in this film and her performance was the most interesting to watch. Other characters did well but they were flat. The tomorrow job is about three thieves. In this time line there is a drug that lets you travel forward in time and it helps see things that might happen, and they want to steal what the future holds. There's loads of stuff about paradox's and what not and overall it was easy to follow, thoug confusing at times witg good and bad acting. But an interesting enough plot to make it entertaining."},

This is all in spite of the gang leader's carefully constructed scenarios to prevent such paradoxes and time loops. The gang come under attack by operatives who apparently come from decades in the future. The mechanics of the time travel is well handled and the drug has a backstory.

It's a good thing these are short, I almost turned it off after the second story and even relatively better ones dont seem good enough to stand alone. The best part is the fake advertisements and style touches between stories. In an example of bad, one story has a twist that appears the fellow is just wearing an obvious rubber mask.

Neither are very keen on this arrangement but patrimonial loyalty and all that... An early shoulder massage illustrates really early on that these two are not a marriage made in heaven. Indeed, she proves considerably more adept than him at just about everything and is also unafraid of speaking her mind in front of his nobles - and women, well that just wasn't done! What now ensues does have an element of predictability to it, but this period of 16th century Japanese history is fraught with intrigues, political machinations, duplicity and ambition - and over the next 2¾ hours we have a decently paced unravelling of a generation of dynastic ambitions and manoeuvring that looks good and holds the attention well. Ayase takes the acting plaudits - she delivers well; and the others contribute adequately as the story advances. For me, it was the focus on the internecine society of love and honour your lord whilst you figure out ways to stab him in the back that worked well here. Loads of CGI - well it is 2023, after all, but the costumier and armourer's arts are well represented and the combat scenes spare us the worst excesses of repetition. It's a long slot of your day to commit to on the television, and I wonder if it would look better on a cinema screen, but if it's a genre in which you've an interest, then this is well worth a watch."},

Aya Ueto's portrayal exudes unwavering strength, while Takuya Kimura's character evolves from hesitation to determined success and ultimately to a supremely confident ruler.

This young man was and is Frank Isaac \"Sugar Chile\" Robinson, born 12/28/1938, and is still alive.

And, when it comes to designating who truly is the king of rock 'roll, this documentary from director Lisa Cortes does just that. Richard Wayne Penniman - professionally known as Little Richard (1932-2020) - burst onto the pop music scene in the mid-1950s with a singular, unrestrained, high-energy style that set him apart from other aspiring performers at the time, achieving tremendous success with hits like \"Tutti Fruitti\" and \"Long Tall Sally,\" among others. However, even though he developed a strong following and a reputation for chart-busting releases, he never quite attained the widespread notoriety of others, like Elvis Presley and Pat Boone, particularly when they covered his hits. He also didn't achieve the financial success that he deserved, thanks to record labels that gave him raw deals. What's more, as a flamboyant, openly gay Black musician at a time when those qualities were far from well tolerated, he became a target for ostracism and scorn from conservative circles, whose leaders spouted inflammatory claims that he was undermining the moral fabric of traditional American culture with his \"decadent\" music and \"perverted\" lifestyle. Yet his blend of colorful performances, mixed with outlandish costumes, pancake makeup and frenetic stage antics and backed by tunes that fused boogie woogie, rhythm & blues and gospel, made him a standout, a style that countless artists drew from - and openly acknowledged his influence - when they emerged in their own right, many of whom are interviewed in the film in archive footage or recent conversations. The result here is a revelatory examination of someone who set a standard but who never received the degree of recognition he merited until many years after his debut on the music scene. \"Little Richard: I Am Everything\" features a wealth of historical footage, including many interviews with the artist himself, along with observations from the likes of Mick Jagger, Billy Porter, Paul McCartney, Tom Jones, Nona Hendryx and superfan filmmaker John Watters, as well as an array of music industry, African-American and gay community historians. Viewers are likely to come away from this offering knowing a lot about Little Richard that they hadn't known previously, enabling them to gain a new appreciation for the rock icon and learning much about the many triumphs and challenges he faced during his colorfully enigmatic life. Audiences are sure to come away from this one proclaiming \"Long live rock - and the king who finally gets to wear his much-deserved crown.\""},

Gaining fans from the unlikeliest of places; England (in the form of the Beatles & Stones) Richard was soon on his way musically but his own personal demons; being gay & non-secular at the same time would dog him for the rest of his career sometimes where he'd renounce his sexuality for the church & vice versa but his real annoyance came in the form of not being recognized for his sizable, quantifiable influence on rock music (witness the montage of artists he influenced w/Harry Styles himself wearing gender bending clothes appealing to the masses) which was hopefully rectified by the end of his life.

Unfortunately, LR: I Am Everything is a patchy chronicle of Richard's life and his manic swings between sexually-liberated rock-n-roller and homophobic fire-and-brimstone god botherer. In the end Lisa Cortes clumsily answers the question \"Who was Little Richard?\" by lamely accepting he was both of these extremes and that this was somehow okay. Except it wasn't okay because LR clearly had a tortured existence, traumatised by religion, constantly at war with himself. The pain is etched in his face through many of the interviews featured here, and his wildest, most outrageous behaviour suggests someone who was mentally unstable, if not suffering from some undiagnosed illness. The way he was variously exploited, discarded and celebrated by the music industry also cries out for a more nuanced and forensic examination. In the end, attempting to make this a celebration of Little Richard felt bizarrely discordant and wrong. Little Richard's life was a rolling tragedy. He never attained any peace (despite what his religious followers will claim). And his musical output was meagre because of the pain and exploitation he endured.

In this film it looks like Gandhi ji is giving explanation for all the disastrous decisions he took before and after the Independence. This film has nothing to do with the history. I will suggest you not to waste your time on this film, and yes if you wanna watch it then just watch it as a fictional drama that has nothing to do with reality. This movie is similar to Tide(washing powder) advertisement , It just tries to clean the image of Gandhi ji. If we talk about Godse, he is just portrayed as a villain who realises his mistake at the end of the film and accepted Gandhi ji and his ideology . This film just tries to balance things that happened in our past which makes no sense."},

Very sad to see only few screens were given to this movie with most preferring Pathan over this. Had there been a big actor this movie would have been a blockbuster only word of mouth which I am sure will be great should save the film provided it gets enough screen space. Acting was top notch.

The overall impression which you get after watching is that godse was an immature guy who only believed in hindu rashtra ideology and out of sheer anger he tried to kill gandhi. But what about his speech which he gives in the court... What about the background and reasoning of him trying to kill gandhi... None of it has been shown. This is 2023 and there is a lot of information floating around.... I would definitely suggest the director that if this is the level of presentation u think people are expecting.,then you seriously need to work on your craft. Rather than this fictional tale where godse saves gandhi in the end and they both come out as a friend, had the director shown what actually happened, it would have gone far better. The movie may show the facts but the emotional impact which it creates is the valorisation of gandhi's ideology....."},

And this film, an 'after-hours' dissection offers a fresh look at history that is mildly thought provoking yet surprisingly light-headed and entertaining. It does leave you with questions, answers, and some more things to reflect upon. As someone who comes from both the schools of thought through lineage, I chuckled at how accurate some depictions were- of believers, of naysayers and of followers who choose to follow for no particular or sound basis/reason. Rajkumar Santoshi and team have given us a film that feels fresh in its devices, the lightness of touching narratives set in stone through decades. AR Rahman's score gave me chills at many places. Goes without saying that man understand cinema, emotions, dialog and poignance of it all like a master. The use of silences and mellow instruments like a flute here a pipe there and the symphonic touches are just other-worldly and underline the film's honest storytelling. Vaishnav Jan To sequence, the opening credits, the end credits suite(Raghupati Raghav) and Godse theme are all Rahman gems from his endless vault of magic."},

The story follows two parallel yet opposing protagonists, one a world leading marine geologist, the other a CEO of a mining company.

David Garber (\"Sgt. Alexander\") and Michael Southworth (\"Sgt. Reese\") are charged with leading a secret CIA mission whilst facing opposition from their tenacious enemy and, as the two men come to terms with their own sexuality, with their colleague's attitude to that - all whilst under fire and in hostile terrain. The narrative here is all over the place. The lacklustre direction and soporific score; the really mediocre writing and the stilted acting all contribute to what is essentially a throughly unremarkable piece of cinema that seems to have no idea who it is for, or what it is trying to say - beyond the bleeding (quite literally) obvious. Most films from this theatre of war depict tragedy and brutality - but most do it far more cogently than this insipid melodrama that uses a gay angle to the story to thinly disguise a poor piece of wartime story-telling. It can't have had much of a budget and much of it looks like it was filmed in someone's back yard. It probably was, and maybe they could just stick to showing it there, too. Very poor."},

It is a heartfelt representation of probably 1,000's of soldiers who were not only coming of age as men, (the average age of Vietnam soldiers was 19) but finding their own sexual identity. With the backdrop of an increasingly senseless and unwinnable war, the film captures the heartbreaking consequences of love in the midst of volatile uncertainty.

The cinematography, acting and script were all good. I didn't find the openness of the gay love story credible, but it didn't matter. The theme of acceptance under harsh conditions and the sheer power of love are fundamental to the human psyche. We didn't get to see how the two gay soldiers formed an unbreakable, romantic bond, under such unlikely circumstances. Instead we are introduced to their characters after their relationship has already evolved. So we don't get any insights into how they were able to overcome social and military stigmas around gay men. One of my favorite scenes was when the helicopters rescued them. The script, the acting...the emotional pain and responses all resonated with realness."},

I felt he really gave you an inside look at the mindset of someone in that position during that horrible time. The only real cons of the movie were the special effects like the bullets and the explosions, you could definitely tell they were CGI, but this is expected due to the low budget on the film. I would have like to have seen more aerial fighting as well with the choppers using their weapons against the enemy during the transporting of the soldiers during the battle.

{"movie_id": "tt18554676", "reviewer_name": "Giuseppe_Silecchia", "review_date": "Apr 20, 2024", "review_score": "5", "review_text": "I Migliori Giorni, the new anthology film directed by Edoardo Leo and Massimiliano Bruno, presents itself as an unflinching mirror reflecting the harsh reality of human connections during the holidays. Despite the promising cast of well-known actors, the final result falls somewhere between bittersweet comedy and a depiction of everyday hypocrisies. In this mosaic of four episodes, the film explores family, social, and romantic dynamics, focusing on Christmas, New Year's Eve, Valentine's Day, and International Women's Day. While the stories are well-written, they sometimes lack the depth needed to leave a lasting impact. The first episode, centered around family divisions regarding vaccination, offers a sharp and timely glimpse into society. However, the tone falters towards the end, missing the opportunity to further delve into the raised issues. The second episode, which delves into the hypocrisy of an entrepreneur seeking moral redemption, presents an intriguing premise but loses itself in a plot without a meaningful conclusion. The third episode, set on Valentine's Day, attempts to explore polyamory and fidelity but ends up falling into clichés and predictable situations. Finally, the last episode, focused on International Women's Day and the condemnation of misogynistic TV programming, offers a positive note, but even here, the ending feels overly optimistic, missing the chance to delve deeper into the raised themes. The film's strength lies in the performances of the actors, particularly in the trio of siblings played by Edoardo Leo, Anna Foglietta, and Massimiliano Bruno. Their chemistry and authenticity bring a touch of humanity to the stories, although at times the dialogue feels overly dramatic. The direction by Leo and Bruno, while competent, shows some uncertainties in handling the endings of the episodes, which tend to deflate rather than conclude decisively. The soundtrack effectively underscores the different atmospheres but at times feels intrusive, overshadowing the actors' performances. I Migliori Giorni offers an interesting and at times touching glimpse into human nature, but the final result fails to shine as one might expect from such a talented cast. The film may be enjoyable for the general audience, but it leaves a slight sense of dissatisfaction for those expecting a deeper reflection on current social dynamics."},

And yes, up until now, I don't remember seeing him in anything other than (lower grade) B-rate material. (Disclaimer: myself being a connoisseur of SyFy originals AND/OR not liking the very mentioned A. Schwartzenegger either, or, say, S. Stallone having some roles he doesn't want you to know). But who cares about it as long as this particular film is perfectly watchable and enjoyable in the finest spaghetti western tradition. I can't find any obvious flaws with its direction, acting, dialogue, music, camera work, etc. Everything looks solid, and the film being rather short, is a plus in my view, as I am SO tired fast forwarding through 3-hour dribble so common these days. Can't wait for the sequel."},

What can I say about the work of Alexander and director Joe Cornet, the film is really not bad and you don't want to turn it off after 10 minutes. The secondary characters are interesting, but it would be cool to reveal more of their stories/backstories. The fact that the main character is based on a historical figure is very cool.

From the outset, the script feels poorly constructed, with clunky dialogue and a storyline that lacks any real engagement or originality. The directing fails to bring any nuance or depth to the material, leaving the actors struggling to make something out of nothing. Even the usually talented cast seems lost, with performances that come across as flat and uninspired. The production design and cinematography are unbelievably subpar, lacking any creativity or visual appeal. It's baffling how someone as talented as Bob Odenkirk ended up in a project like this. Perhaps it seemed promising on paper or was a result of contractual obligations, but it's hard to reconcile his involvement with the overall quality of the film.

The film's strength lies in its ability to balance the harsh realities of Ichemrahen's past with the enchanting world of haute pâtisserie. The scenes in the kitchen are a feast for the eyes, filled with exquisite desserts and the intense pressure of competition. The performances are solid, particularly from Riadh Belaïche, who portrays Ichemrahen with a compelling blend of vulnerability and fierce determination. The narrative is often predictable, following a well-trodden path of underdog success stories, but it's executed with sincerity and charm.

The first 30 minutes were the roughest to get through, but eventually it rolls into its basic premise with a plot device spotted a mile away. The acting was OK, but not always convincing. Truthfully, a little above what I was expecting for this lower budget category. It tries to be clever with surreal story effects (dreams, I guess) but doesn't really land. For its budget, the sound design and audio are good, however, it would have scored better with me if it wasn't for the over-used camera/editing gimmicks. Dark filters, blur filters, bouncy/shaky cam, and even in this case, upside-down scenes, which in my opinion, worked against it and became distracting if not annoying. It is not completely void of intensity or good shots, so it did have its moments. No, Bianca does not do the splits and clobber opponents in the groin with a banshee wail, but she does rough it up, in more ways than one, even if upside-down."},

The movie features the story of a wedding singer, who sings \"taverna muzigi\" (tavern music) in a pianist (or keyboard player) singer-songwriter style in 1980's. This style, which the singers often sang songs of personal troubles, impossible-loves, love-sickness, sadness, and tragedies, was famous in that era. Ata Demirer, known for his sincere comedies, drifts from this style and moves to a different style, which has lots of famous examples, in which real singers had sung and played in movies of that era. However this movie falls beyond expectations, with lots of poor acting (except Özge Özacar) and and fragmented narratives. The movie can be said to be mediocre, except amazing songs made and sang by Ata Demirer himself."},

Probably because we're accustomed to his higher performances, it was an extremely disappointing experience for me.

But when you keep watching that it tells us a quite in a unique and effective way that ain't drops attention of the viewers . I strongly reccomended you to watch this movie , i try to avoid the not giving spoilers soo the viewer might get fresh and great experience with it . Thanks Ata Demirel for this wonderful movie , i must admit that for his previous movie experiences i just thought that this movies is kind of one of it's smilar and kinda ok movies , but in this movie really his best movie .

I watched his movies and stand up show many times. He is a perfect talent. In my first review I said I didn't like the movie because it is not a comedy and I didn't laugh at all but I misjudged the movie, this is a musical drama and when I think like that, I can say Ata Demirer executes perfect job. It is so naive with lots of details and also very well observed of period... Also it has a deep story about being looser or I don't know unlucky maybe.. I really loved it. Also I loved the woman singer voice so much,very arabesque.. I hope we can see second movie with happy final. Good characterizations, nice scenes and lovely 80s atmosphere... Really Good job.

After a number of days, Tala and Bayani set out into the forest to find father. Tala comes upon this shelter, and enters. A fairy appears, saying that only one who is truly innocent could find and enter, and she can provide wishes. To cure the mother, she gives Tala a jar with an insect inside. As the mother gets worse, one night Tala sets the insect on her mother, and it crawls inside her. Well, think along the lines of the monkey paw as to what happens. There is always a catch.

The film highlights the brave men and women from Indigenous communities who protested to protect their land and water. The main character Dan Mckinney, played by William Mapother, brought a compelling perspective to the already multifaceted story. As a veteran suffering from PTSD, Dan experienced flashbacks throughout the film that gave the audience greater insight into his past. This unique perspective anchored the character and allowed greater light to shine on the 2,000 veterans supporting the Native protesters. Societal treatment of veterans and Native rights are two themes that are intrinsically bound in On Sacred Ground. This film tells a compelling story about the struggles Native communities are facing and the lengths gone to discredit their mission."},

Directors Rebecca and Josh Tickell did a wonderful job portraying the narrative of the continuation of the Dakota Access Pipeline over the Lakota \"Sioux\" Tribe's land. On Sacred Ground included voices from true Native Americans, which showed their respect for those whose story was being written. By representing the indigenous women in such a way that showed audiences how they were vocal and strong and not instigating and violent was a great way that this motion picture gave respect to the Lakota Tribe. This cinematic masterpiece has many powerful layers, including the display of PTSD suffered by veterans, the ethical dilemma of a journalist, and the life of a married couple with a baby on the way. Despite all these conflicts, the awareness for protecting indigenous rights does not take a back seat. This motion picture has a voice of its own and I highly recommend watching On Sacred Ground for a moving cinematic experience."},

The trauma they experience overseas is often overlooked and unfortunately mental health programs are not prioritized enough. The Tickell's also made sure to acknowledge the injustice that Indigenous women face. This is a topic that I personally have not seen talked about on screen before.

Indeed Jönson's story has been told first in the Swedish movie Vägen Ut by Daniel Lind Lagerlöf, and then in the documentary Les Prisonniers de Beckett by Michka Saäl. Through the documentary by Michka Saäl, the filmmaker Emmanuel Courcoul has made the French movie Un triomphe, which has been a huge success for the audience and the critics. Then the filmmaker Riccardo Milani seems interested to direct the remake of the movie Un Triomphe, by maintaining the main basis of the story while changing some elements, including to turn it into an Italian film. The director even calls the actor Antonio Albanese, as they have worked with each other several times, to be the main character. In 2023 came out Grazie ragazzi by Riccardo Milani, with Antonio Albanese, Sonia Bergamasco, Vinicio Marchioni, Giacomo Ferrara, Giorgio Montanini, Andrea Lattanzi, and Fabrizio Bentivoglio. The movie's plot: Antonio (Antonio Albanese), a failed but passionate theatre actor, who works as voice actor in porno movies in order to maintain himself economically, gets offered by his old friend and colleague Michele (Fabrizio Bentivoglio), the job as a teacher in a theater workshop at a penitentiary institute. Antonio eventually accepts the job, even though he is skeptical about it, until he sees the opportunity to get five inmates and staging out of the prison the notorious play Waiting for Godot by Samuel Beckett. Since the announcement of the movie, the audience and the critics have been curious about how the story will come out differently from the movie Un Triomphe, while maintaining the main basis of the story. Indeed, the movie has become a surprising one that tells an extraordinary story, by balancing the humor and drama with a touch of realism without distorting its narration, especially in the most essential moments of the movie. The production designer Marta Maffucci created the settings to have a natural look, by showing the feelings of the main characters, whenever there are some of the funniest moments as well as the most emotional one to be unforgettably impactful. The costume designer Francesca Renda has elaborated the costumes to have a specific look by using the simplest elements, to be enough effective on how the main characters will be shown during the stage as well as out of it. The director of photography Saverio Guarna has captured the humor and the drama, in every camera movements and in every angle shots needed for the story to be shown, making some of the scenes as well as sequences of the story unforgettable. The editors Patrizia Ceresani and Francesco Renda have created the narration's rhythm of the movie that balances the humor and the drama without distorting the final result; in the same way, to see how the characters development evolves from the beginning to the end, by showing unexpected surprises. The score by Andrea Guerra has been elaborated to create specific musical notes, by letting the audience and the critics feel the humor and the drama from the beginning to the end of the story, without distorting melodically its rhythm, especially when the main characters are facing in some of the most specific moments of the story. Antonio Albanese did an extraordinary performance as Antonio, a failed but passionate theater actor who accepts to be the teacher in a theater workshop at a penitentiary institute, once he takes the opportunity to stage Waiting for Godot by Samuel Beckett with five inmates out of the prison, he will then see something that surprises him enough to make him even more passionate about it. Sonia Bergamasco did an excellent performance as Laura, the head of detention who initially does not really believe at the idea of Antonio to stage the play Waiting for Godot out of the prison, as she does not want to have any kind of dangerous risks with the prison inmates, but then she will see the unexpected surprises without letting her guard down. Vinicio Marchioni did a well done performance as Diego, one of main prison inmate who takes part of Waiting for Godot stage, even he is known for being particularly dangerous to have bad reputation, he will eventually show to be much more vulnerable than what he might want to show. Giacomo Ferrara did an excellent performance as Aziz, the prison inmate of Libyan origin who also takes part of Waiting for Godot stage, since then he and the rest of the prison inmates will show to have an enormous satisfaction to accomplish something special that is beyond than what they could have imagine. Giorgio Montanini did a well done performance as Mignolo, a prison inmate who is the funniest character among the inmates of Waiting for Godot stage to have even a goofy girlfriend that is impressed by his talent. Andrea Lattanzi did an excellent performance as Diamiano, a prison inmate who initially stutters when it comes to memorize one of the most difficult monologues of the stage, until he changes to recite the monologue perfectly and be even feel much more confident with himself. Fabrizio Bentivoglio did a well done performance as Michele, the old friend and colleague of Antonio who gives him the job of being a teacher of theater workshop at a penitentiary institute, he is initially skeptical when Antonio proposes the idea of staging out of the prison Waiting for Godot, until he sees how it comes out to be even more helpful and supportive to Antonio. Grazie ragazzi is an excellent movie, which balances the humor and drama with a touch of realism, to surprise the audience and the critics from the beginning to the end."},

Smith. This captivating examination of the lives of four African-American transsexual sex workers in New York, Atlanta and Miami shares stories of their experiences, their outlooks on their vocation and how they view themselves in relation to the Black community at large. It also features interviews with the clients and supporters of these individuals and how they relate to one another, both as objects of desire and sometimes as loving, adoring friends/partners. Beautifully shot in black-and-white, the film holds little back in telling the stories of its subjects, both in terms of dialogue and images (so sensitive viewers take note). And, for its efforts, the picture has been widely honored by film festivals and critics associations, as well as a recipient of best documentary nominations by the Independent Spirit Awards, the Critics Choice Documentary Awards and the Directors Guild of America. That's quite an impressive pedigree for a film that might not have even been made not all that long ago. It's a real testament to how far we - and cinema - have come over the years."},

Each of them has a story to tell illustrating what initially drove them to this lifestyle, what keeps them earning their money this way - and, ultimately, what they might care to do were they given a decent kick at the ball and an opportunity to escape their cyclical - and often dangerous - existence. The narrative is left to the women, and though they reach the centre of the wheel using different spokes, their conclusions about sexuality amongst the black communities is consistently and often wittily poignant. The roles that society might attribute to the archetypal alpha male being turned on it's head when curtains are drawn and typical bedroom roles enhanced and/or reversed. At times their deliveries can verge on the rant and one, specifically, needed editing but for the most part this is quite an eye-opening introspective from people who don't weep into their coffee cups, but who extol their own virtues clearly, succinctly, very earthily and ultimately I found engagingly. There are a few contributions from others but they seem there just to allow the audience to take a breather from the intensity of the four who have plenty to say - and agree with them or otherwise, it's well worth listening to."},

In fact, it plays into every single perception of who and what you think they are. There was definitely creative license (aka: exaggeration/ lying) taken during the filming of the lives and relationships that are featured. With that being said, the film makers are literally just letting these individuals be whoever they want to be. Their lives and attitudes will make you very sad; they balance their days on a tightrope of love and hate for who they are and what they have to do to survive. They all subsidize their emotions with mood enhancers - which makes sense because they live a very difficult life. This is probably one of the saddest documentaries I've ever seen, primarily because of the illusion almost all of them portray to the camera of being confident, satisfied with their position in the world, and being strong enough to survive it. These are also true in many senses - but not how they think. What IS impressive is their ability to acclimate to horrific circumstances that eventually become 'normal' . What surprised me about a couple of them is their obvious intellect; had they been born under different circumstances they could have been successful business owners, doctors, lawyers, etc. The circumstances of their birth put them on a trajectory where tragic survival or brutal death were their only options and they had to chose, at a VERY young age. Also what is perpetuated is the black on black violence that is so common. There is a caste system in place from birth for this race, whether they want to admit it or not. But it's very much a system they themselves have put into place."},

This is in no way a movie as we know it.

The next morning, she wakes up in a strange bed and upon venturing into the back yard, finds that same blonde swimming in the pool. After a quick breakfast, she is then introduced to the blonde's roommates and told that they have formed a group which is intent upon hacking into a large financial organization known as OPSEC for the purpose of dispersing trillions of dollars from their computer system to the general population. Although Sarah is initially reluctant to join the group, she eventually relents and soon finds herself inside OPSEC with instructions to place a flash drive into one of the computers there which will create all kinds of financial chaos within that financial institution. Now, rather than reveal any more, I will just say that this is easily one of the worst films I have ever seen with a shallow plot, bad acting, a poorly written script and a host of other issues commonly seen with low budget productions in general. Admittedly, Caroline Elise looked nice in her leopard print bikini, but other than that there was nothing here that was even remotely interesting or enjoyable. In short, this was a bad movie, and I have rated it accordingly."},

{"movie_id": "tt24082488", "reviewer_name": "brentsbulletinboard", "review_date": "Feb 8, 2024", "review_score": "8", "review_text": "It's been said that one of the most cherished hopes for a loving relationship is that its partners inevitably have someone with whom they can grow old together, a time when they can warmly look back on their time as a couple with fondness and treasured memories. But what happens when something occurs that threatens to steal those precious recollections? That's one of the tragedies that can come with various forms of dementia, such as Alzheimer's Disease, a condition that seriously endangered the long-term loving partnership of renowned Chilean author/journalist Augusto Góngora and his wife, actress and former Minister of Culture Paulina Urrutia. But, rather than seeking seclusion in the wake of that diagnosis, Góngora insisted on making his story public, telling the tale of his condition and the diligent, compassionate efforts of Urrutia in acting as his caregiver, particularly in helping him hold on to his memory as fully and as long as possible. Their story is sensitively recounted in writer-director Maite Alberdi's moving documentary, a film that will simultaneously warm and break your heart. In telling their tale, this title explores the importance of preserving one's memories as a measure of one's identity and accomplishments, both personally and professionally. In Góngora's case, that involves the depth of his love for his wife, family and friends, as well as the critical role he played in making the Chilean public aware of the grotesque atrocities that unfolded in the wake of the country's 1973 coup d'etat and the restoration of the nation's cultural and artistic heritage after its return to democracy with the ouster of the Pinochet regime in 1990. Those recollections, in his view, represent a depth of courage that's to be preserved and not lost to the ravages of time and illness. This Oscar nominee for best documentary feature and its designation as one of 2023's top documentaries by the National Board of Review is a striking piece of filmmaking, one that's sure to touch virtually anyone who watches it (but be sure to keep those hankies handy). When we consider what can potentially be lost under circumstances like these, any efforts made to prevent that are truly heroic steps to be commended, and this film does an outstanding job at making that known, both in this case and as a practice to be employed whenever comparable conditions arise."},

We are introduced to Augusto Gongora and his wife Paulina Urrutia. The former was an accomplished television journalist in Chile during it's frequently turbulent times, she an acclaimed actress and they have, by 2023, been married for a quarter of a century. What we discover quickly is that he is suffering from Alzheimer's and as the pair continue through the life, both dread what they know to be coming: the day when he will no longer know who she is. This is one of those rare documentaries where the actuality of the political trouble and strife actually serve to deliver us a bit of a breather from the intensity of this most human of stories as the couple wake up each morning without any idea what that day may bring. The lockdown scenario and the hand-held photography ensures that there are few other characters to divert our focus from this intimate and heart-rending depiction of their determination not to allow this disease to prevail any earlier than they have to. Their habits and routines are designed to elicit as many memories and triggers as possible to enable Augusto to hold onto his soul for just that bit longer, but he isn't a King Canute and even throughout the timeframe of this documentary we see that they cannot thwart the inevitable. It's not some melancholy affair, though. Their grandchildren enliven things and this couple are still very much up for the joys of life. There is plenty of laughter to remind us that it's life they want to live, not just an existence they wish to seek. From an observer's perspective we also get a little of the sense of the frustration felt by this man who, as a journalist, was a voracious reader but who can no longer enjoy his vast library. We also see a dedication and affection from Paulina who must also recalibrate from time to time to ensure that she doesn't succumb to the relentless pressures of living such an unpredictable life. This isn't an easy watch, but over ninety minutes we get an insight into just how spirit and a sense of humour can still make a difference."},

Augusto and Paulina have been together for 25 years. Augusto has been diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease and the day is not far when he'll stop recognising her. Covid lockdown makes it worse for the couple because they are cut off from friends and his condition worsens much more quickly because of the isolation. The film uses archival footage to show glimpses from their past. Paulina is much younger to Augusto Góngora, a prominent journalist from when Pinochet was in power. She is the minister of Culture. He's also very popular amongst his friends. Paulina sticks by his side as his condition fails. It's these scenes that are really touching, her dedication and commitment even as he's drifting into the darkness. It's the memory of love that sustains them, and it's this memory which is eternal, even as the physical body deteriorates. Kudos to Maite Alberdi for making this great love story."},

But, if that's genuinely the case, then why did it take American nuclear weapons developers 928 tests to do figure out that their devices indeed worked? That's not an unreasonable question, but it's one of many such issues raised in this often-shocking documentary from directors Douglas Brian Miller and Mark Shapiro. According to the film, between 1951 and 1992, the US government detonated 100 aboveground and 828 underground nuclear weapons at the Nevada Nuclear Testing Grounds, with fallout from these blasts spreading downwind from the detonation site (and not just in the immediate vicinity). This relentless onslaught of tests thus earned the US the dubious distinction of having experienced the heaviest bombardment of atomic devices on the planet. This weapons research subsequently affected a wide range of the population, from resident Native Americans to Hollywood movie crews working in nearby desert filming locales to average citizens far removed from the site of the explosions, nearly all of whom were disparagingly and uncaringly looked upon as expendable \"for the sake of national security.\" The resulting widespread environmental damage and devastating public health effects are still being felt to this day, ramifications that are likely to be around for many, many years to come. And, to add insult to injury, through a carefully orchestrated campaign of propaganda and disinformation, the public has been misled for decades regarding the severity of this calamity. The film details all of these issues, both on the macro level and in a variety of personal case studies, through a variety of recent interviews and a wealth of archive material (including a number of now-laughable government-sponsored films), all narrated by actor Martin Sheen. While the contents of a few of this documentary's segments could have been a little better organized, the magnitude of these troubling revelations is quite astounding, particularly in terms of how much this story has been downplayed and the extent of lies that have been systemically perpetrated over the years. And don't become complacent in thinking that this is all in the past: The film reveals that present-day proponents of this type of testing would like to see the current moratorium against them ended in favor of a new round of experiments. And, if that's not unsettling enough to get our attention, I don't know what is. Do watch this."},

What I found especially pleasing were the performances of the main four actors that were in complete harmony - every actor was complimenting another and together they formed a compact performance where noone was towering over the others, which given the plot would be very disruptive in my opinion. I also appreciated the inclusion of positive religious thoughts on polyamory (one of the main characters is a priest), because too often people think that polyamory is not compatible with being a Christian. In that way \"Four Little Adults\" remind us that we can't choose who we love and, like in this case, how many people we love."},

At the same time, there were also competing, carefully concealed factions within their ranks quietly battling one another, relying on the same kinds of tactics used against their mutual enemies, for who would control the country during the post-war era, pitting Chinese nationalists against the rising tide of Communism. That tangled web of moves and counter-moves is effectively brought to life in writer-director Er Cheng's fourth feature outing, a film that seamlessly combines works drawn from the historical drama, action-adventure, thriller and arthouse genres, quite an accomplishment for such widely diverse materials. The picture's fine period piece production values, excellent ensemble cast (especially protagonists Tony Leung and Yibo Wang), atmospheric cinematography and superb special effects blend well to tell an engaging, visually tantalizing tale that gets better and better the further one gets into the story. Admittedly, the filmmaker's less-than-veiled political symbolism, which obviously is meant to bolster Chinese propagandist sentiments, can be seen as somewhat over the top at times. Moreover, the director's assumptions regarding audience foreknowledge of mid-20th Century Chinese history can occasionally leave viewers somewhat baffled and frustrated (though one should bear in mind that this was made for a Chinese audience). What's more, the picture's out-of-sequence storytelling can be a little frustrating (especially in the first hour), though, thanks to the film's inspired editing, the narrative cleverly circles back to its origins as the movie goes on, making up for what some may see as a shortcoming. However, these considerations aside, \"Hidden Blade\" is a surprising little gem, one that, hopefully, won't get lost in a sea of lesser releases or pictures that capture undeserved praise."},

The lingering tension continues to build as seemingly irrelevant narratives, discourses, and incidents begin to unfold, intersect, and repeat, embroidering a convoluted story with the aid of purposefully fragmented editing. However, lacking both historical contextualization and relational clarification, the movie demands much heed, deduction, and prior knowledge from its audience to fully comprehend and rationalize the plot. And yet, if you do manage to wade through the mist, you will find the tale hither and thither illogical, or flawed, for instance the riveting hallway brawl moderately contradicts the final revelation. Speaking of which, the prolix denouement marginally punctures the perfectly constructed angst in the first act, limiting blankness of interpretation. Overall, sublime performances, stylistic presentation, and undoubtedly a film I recommend."},

The warning signs were there from the minute the cameras started rolling - this is a deeply unwell young man who seems unable to parse reality from delusion, and his story inevitably ends in violence. But hey, he gets clicks so the Kardashian producers want to give him a reality TV show. He looks uncomfortable, like a caged animal in a zoo, but I want a selfie to show my friends. Most of the interviews are industry people detailing the various ways they tried to profit off of him while ignoring glaringly obvious red flags, with few if any showing remorse or even self-awareness. This doc also borders on exploitative, but it has value as a satire of our celebrity-obsessed culture and flippant attitude towards mental illness. I'm just not sure that was the goal."},

When police and family are interviewed, we truly begin to see behind the veil of Kai's homeless hippie hero persona."},

The film absolutely depicts how everyone overlooked the warning signs regarding Kai and I think viewers are more subconsciously upset with the media back in 2013 that got everyone behind this guy, perhaps even more upset with themselves for being part of the duped movement that jumped on his bandwagon. I also understand that many people feel that Kai has received punishment unjustly for the murder and that his victim was killed in self defence. I understand this thinking, he is a likeable personality, but for me it's just hard to get passed certain details - like Kai getting caught on camera hugging the guy AFTER the night he claims that the rape took place, as well as the extremely excessive damage that the old man sustained to his head. What more can be said? The disdain for this film seems like another example of how stubborn and group-thinking the masses have become, the people criticizing this movie are likely not Rhodes Scholars (although neither am I) and are probably better suited to be watching less troubling material like Ginny and Georgia or Toopy and Binoo. Get off your dang high horses and try creating your own art before running your mouths, because this documentary has it all. Of course, you are entitled to your opinion, I just think it's a bit of a shame. I guess it would be most prudent to remember the words of Kai himself: \"you're worthwhile\" and so is this documentary. For me, it's a Smash, smash, Suh-mash!"},

The unbridled glee that all these media figures have when recalling their time with Kai is disgusting. There is no self-reflection. No sense of responsibility. No question of what kind of role they played in Kai's downward spiral. NOTHING. They just cared about how they can monetize his existence and enable his dysfunctional behavior. If all of that doesn't sound stomach-turning enough, there is also an overwhelming amount of stigma and disdain for unhoused people. Half of this documentary is remarkably tone-deaf exploitation and the other half is your standard, unreliable Copaganda garbage. I almost turned it off as soon as the East Cost cops show up.

For viewers not familiar with Kai, the narrative here successfully weaves the story of how a random person catapults to fame in a matter of days and then spirals downward at the same speed, winding up in what has to be one of life's worst predicaments. The storytelling is delivered through good editing, visuals, stock footage, and candid interviews. One criticism is the somewhat rushed and abrupt ending, as if 57 years in prison is nothing to balk at.

It's definitely a showcase for writer-director Savanah Leaf, whose considerable artistic sensibilities are clearly apparent in her first feature outing. The same can be said for lead actress Tia Nomore, making her screen debut in a genuinely moving performance. Unfortunately, the vehicle in which their talents are being put to use could stand to be better. This story of the bureaucratic turmoil faced by a single mother in recovery who's pregnant with her third child (and her first two in foster care) sincerely seeks to evoke viewer empathy for the circumstances she's enduring. At the same time, though, the story also raises many questions about responsibility (or a lack thereof), an admittedly honest depiction of conditions that are often present in these scenarios that, nevertheless, tends to undercut the pursuit of that aforementioned goal, leaving viewers (like yours truly) confused about what to truly feel. Add to that a somewhat thin narrative that feels padded to fill out the runtime, and one has a picture that comes up short of its objective, despite the efforts of a fine ensemble cast and engaging cinematography. This production's National Board of Review accolades and Independent Spirit Award nominations aside, Leaf and Nomore genuinely deserve better material to show audiences what they're capable of. Regrettably, however, this isn't it."},

She's a woman expecting her third child in San Francisco, with the other two already in the care system and she seems to be thinking this latest one will be adopted. We have no idea where the child's father is - indeed, men don't feature much at all in this film - so we are quickly immersed in her sense of isolation and loneliness from the start. It's not an emotionally charged, woe-is-me, sort of loneliness - it's more of a realisation that she wants to be on her own, thrives better on her own, won't get let down on her own. The thrust of the narrative now attempts to confront that approach and demonstrate to her that there are plenty amongst her community who could be there to help, to engage and to integrate with. It's a nicely photographed film with camerawork that provides us with an intimate glimpse into this troubled woman's life, but the story is really nothing new and the storyline emphasises all too clearly the difficulties of trying to have a child whilst reliant on over-stretched state infrastructure without addressing any of her own social and behavioural responsibilities to herself and unborn child. Indeed, she comes across frequently as a rather selfish, almost, childish herself, kind of character who thinks nothing of walking through the park stealing nappies from other recent mothers! It has moments that are poignant, and it does look good - but it's way too simplistic and just a little one-sided for me. I expect to see more of Nomore though."},

The camerawork in Earth Mama offers surreal expressionistic moments juxtaposed with raw documentary-esque storytelling and Leaf's forceful authorial voice confidently allows the stunning images of her characters and the Bay Area locations to often say more than is contained in the subtle dialogue.

So, not my first rodeo. A younger viewer checking this feature out might instantly notice that it does not follow any typical arc or maintain the usual rhythm. And that would be incorrect. It is, in fact, true to the internal pacing of the original Kung Fu Tv series and even mentions that show in the script, as an homage. The larger question is, does it entertain? Answer: barely. If this is a favorite genre of yours, it contains enough interesting tropes to justify a look. Whether it justifies a sequel, on the other hand, is another question entirely.

The film is filled with cluster of events one after another which keeps you engaged but it feels like over-saturation after first half. The film follows a rashomon structure,and a labyrinth of perspectives and coincidences galore as it progresses. The screenplay lacks depth and fails to make the characters dark as the premise of the film demands. The visuals,score demands more grittier approach than the narrative follows,none of the characters were intimidating enough despite such a great ensemble.

Kuttey. Aasmaan Bhardwaj, in his debut, takes the baton from his father and tries to make a film in that Guy Ritchie and Tarantino space with intermingling heist attempts and long drawn conversations. The choice of style of direction is the \"keep the camera in front of the actors and let them have a go at it\" approach which works wonders if the writing is taut, dialogue is engaging, and the edit is tight. Kuttey fails on all three counts, causing a cascading effect that makes the actors look bad. Stalwarts working so hard on their performances and being let down by the writing and direction is difficult to watch. A lot of the acting looks like it was meant for stage. Editing style and the way events unfold is very similar to Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels but you see it all coming from a mile away. The only positive to come out of this film is the title track wonderfully composed by Vishal Bhardwaj, sung by Rekha Bhardwaj and based on the Faiz Ahmad Faiz's Kutte. The rest of the music is good as well. Except the reused Dhan Te Nan track. The pneumonic plays throughout the film and was a bit disappointing because you don't expect recycling from \"art\" filmmakers. It's one thing to use the track for promotions and to evoke nostalgia but then to play it repeatedly in the film was a bit excessive. Overall a very disappointing film given the long list of exceptional actors, producers, musicians and technicians attached to the project."},

The Prime Minister has given the young man and his prisoner just two hours to get to the bottom of the killing and to retrieve a letter thought to have been contained in an ornate leather purse.

The storyline is simple enough - the entire movie revolves around two central characters searching for the truth and a disappeared letter following the murder of an enemy official. The allegiances and true intentions of the central characters, including that of the support characters, are often deceiving and offer surprising \"reveals\". Themes of loyalty and the willingness to sacrifice oneself for a greater belief is explored throughout, and comedic dialogue often takes places to keep the film in a general light tone. Having taken the number 1 box office in China over the Chinese New Year period, this is a film to demonstrate why Zhang remains one of China's best directors."},
{"movie_id": "tt21148018", "reviewer_name": "flcntk3-856-986017", "review_date": "Mar 11, 2023", "review_score": "3", "review_text": "Historically based films almost always use the past to comment or reflect on the present, and \"Full River Red\" is no exception. This is directed by Zhang Yimou, the person who brought you \"Hero\", a film that suggests unification trumps tyranny and thus making tyranny forgivable. The tyrant in that story was Qin Shi Huang, an emperor who burned books and buried scholars alive by the mass. In the case of \"Full River Red\", it borrows from the legendary story surrounding the hero of Yue Fei by using Qín Huì, the person who purportedly was instrumental for Fei's death, as the pivotal character to spin an intriguing story not so much about loyalty and betrayal to the emperor as one would expect from the plot, but interestingly sidelining the climax to a different focal point about awakening the army to pledge allegiance to Fei's defense of the Sung's dynastic unity. That was a call to battle for the army to claim land that was lost to the invading Jin. How this point becomes the focusing nexus for the entire film was at that very scene, the army recite in chorus the famous Fei's poem: \"Full River Red \", and that recitation was built to a powerful climatic high point of emotional crescendo. This is what the story is really about. Army allegiance to defend territorial integrity. A sentiment that is in harmony with the current context of Sino-geopolitical ambition from the Chinese Communist Party perpetual helmsman Xi's perspective. Looking back at the message from \"Hero\" to now, you may say \"Full River Red\" is an extension of that same sentiment. That said, Zhang also brought you \"To Live\" in his earliest works. A film that shows empathetically from the inside the harrowing plight of Chinese nationals as they try to adept and survive in the topsy turvy political turmoil of China, especially under the Cultural Revolution and the ruling thumb of the Chinese Communist Party. That grassroot perspective is not lost in \"Full River Red\" either. If you look beneath the sophisticated and well-polished veneer of the film which serves subtly as a Party instrument calling for army's loyalty to defend national integrity, you will see beneath that veneer the overbearing stench and corruption coming from omnipotent power, the callous self-serving use of others, and the maneuvering skills one needs to stay alive where personal truth and integrity if there are any are always best kept close to the chest. As said so at the beginning of my review, historical films are to use the past to reflect and comment on the now and this is exactly what Full Red River is doing. As such, you can say it is propagandistic."},

Those who like pure action or hong kong type of simpified plots will not appreciate this and will mark it as low score. However I suspect Zhang is painting on this broad canvass multiple themes with the underlying one on the geopolitics around China now, hence the hit in China with the masses there. That call to arms when they feel besieged by outside forces has a resounding clang from the recitation of the poem of the name of this film. The other reason is, China audience has a much deeper appreciation for their history and cultural reference - and these themes found in the movie has resonance with them."},

The script is clever in many aspects and the ending is masterful and beautifully done. Well done Zhang Yimou and Jackson Yee. I would also recommend Jackson Yee's other films such as Nice View (available on Netflix), a Little Red Flower and his period Drama The Longest Day in Chang'an."},

The cast doesn't commit to their bits leaving many of the performances high and dry; it's ultimately disapppointing for anyone looking for something resembling Yimou's older works, and there's a horribly awkward tonal shift towards the end.

This movie isn't a non stop action thriller like Escape from Mogadishu. It deals realistically with the process of negotiation with the Taliban step by step with mistakes and all the back and forth dealings. This isn't boring - it's fascinating. The acting is fine. As the negotiator Hwang Jung Min is a superb actor totally convincing - check him out in Narco Saints. Hyun Bin looks sufficiently bronzed and bearded to play a Korean who has been there for a while and knows the ways of the country. Although he has one tense action sequence his character is not a superhero here and that's good. He screws up too. When it's a true story like this one you don't need unrealistic heroics.

Cases of false reporting do occur - but extremely rarely. Almost all of the time the victim is telling the truth. Even if one stumbles upon a fundamentally decent detective, they are trained to treat the victim with the utmost suspicion and disbelief in the initial interview to satisfy the courts that all due diligence was done to ensure they were telling the truth. Even children are not exempt from this treatment- but the perpetrators most definitely are. They are treated as though they are believed until it is proven otherwise, a courtesy that is not extended to victims. It is a system completely devoid of empathy and humanity. And when being interrogated as though they are a suspect and met with disbelief in the wake of such a life altering trauma, a victim can be easily rattled by lies told by unscrupulous police officers with their own agendas. It does not surprise me that the officers featured in this documentary were easily able to confuse and plant seeds of doubt in the minds of these young women. The way that these women were treated is repugnant, unprofessional, inhumane, and also entirely typical of police departments both in the US and Canada alike. This is an important watch for everyone from women to parents to law enforcement and members of the judicial system. Cases like this should never happen. But they do. They happen at a frequency much more than we are aware. If police are overwhelmed by the amount of sexual assaults being reported and the work that that involves, then they should organize and develop much stronger tactics to crack down on the perpetrators. Yet it should be no surprise to anyone to see them take the easier route, silencing victims, instead of putting in the work to deal with the systemic issue of astronomical rates of sexual assault.. Throughout the system as a whole, from the first contact with a police officer right through to the completion of the court process, victims are deterred from coming forward by poor treatment, lack of support, and re-traumatization thereby compromising public safety. This is a most extreme yet by no means rare example of that kind of deterrent. This documentary is a clear and thorough examination of the failings of our system and is an important watch. Change is desperately needed."},

Simply nailed it the way she acts in the movie totally stole the show. Whenever she appears on screen she can easily dominate the other actors. Hatts of to the director who directs such a social topic that is not easy to direct. Screenplay is so fast-paced that not even one second you blink your eyes and it's just delight to watch this type of movies if you have proper story telling with humour and emotional connection. Star-cast is brilliant in the movie. From lead to supporting actors all have done fantastically well and the topic that director wants to show to the audience or trying to connect with it. I can definitely say it has reached within the audience. Bym & songs all are good locations is beautiful. The movie end in a simple way but director can easily create a different perspective in ending which would've given movie a much better ending. But then to it's a total worth watch movie. For humour, social message, problem faced issues etc. Strongly recommended for the audience.. (9/10)."},

Since the job is likely to cause embarrassment to her family she hides this fact but not for long leading to friction with her husband ( Sumeet Vyas), with her family and the orthodox community of the town in general. She then starts a crusade to educate and instigate local women to pressurise their husbands to use condom and free them from the pain of the side effects of the pill.

Having never gone but a close friend would rent the occasional cinematic oddity (he once got me a copy of the workprint for John Woo's Hard Target) from there which due to the tenor of the times went the way of the dodo (like most other video stores) but what kept customers coming back again & again was the eclectic selection they provided but when time came for the business to shutter its doors & its acolytes were worried where the treasure trove of filmic ephemera would go, a surprising wrinkle to the story emerged, as evidenced by the filmmaker, David Redmon. Redmon learned the entire collection would be shipped off to a remote town in Italy under the agreement they would curate the films as an exhibition for travelers to see & even extend a courtesy to former customers who still wanted to rent the occasional vid to make a pilgramage for that purpose. To Redmon's horror when he did manage to find the facility which housed the tapes, water was leaking on some of them from the ceiling & no straight answer was given as to what was going on. What follows is a months long gambit for Redmon to track down 'the' Mr. Kim (who lived in New Jersey & was an aspiring filmmaker in his own right), the custodians of the collection & see if a new deal to bring the tapes back to America could be brokered. Starting off as a proper tribute to a by gone era soon morphs into the loopiest heist escapade any doc has ever seen w/the audience ringside to see the lunacy play itself out."},

The first half of the movie is excellent. The protagonist is ruthless and it's consistent with the character.

Finally, when Henriette Parker (Celeste Wall) goes on the hunt, she does one memorable, violent scene nearing the end of the film. Fun but that the only fun worth mentioning.

I highly recommend it to anyone, not just those interested in Bezos, but also to those who enjoy exploring the realms of business and startups."},

However, the narrative was unusually honest and realistic. Unashamedly acknowledging the privilege he had, while also showing the real risks taken by someone with ostensibly no reason to take them. It also showed, realistically, the nature of plans, which emerged in an ad hoc way. The overdramatized parts were fun and felt great. Taken as a whole, it's a very heartening narrative about life, risks and pride which may help you in your own life. Even though he is a shy dork, he has the soul of Genghis Khan. So it might give you all those MAN feelings too which I never expected. Never give in, never cash out, and be relentless!"},

It's fascinating to see how the screenplay effectively depicts the early days of Amazon. However, I noticed the depiction of Jeff Bezos lacked the level of critique one might anticipate in the current climate. Delving into the background of the production company behind this film revealed their commendable focus on amplifying Hispanic voices and actors in their independent cinema ventures. This aspect of the film particularly resonated with me, adding a unique and culturally rich dimension to the storytelling. The involvement of esteemed Hispanic composer Emilio Estefan further elevates the film's appeal, adding a touch of musical brilliance. Watching this film feels like a more meaningful investment of time and resources, especially when considering the burgeoning journey of independent filmmakers as opposed to the already well-established trajectory of figures like Bezos. It's a refreshing change to support emerging talents in the film industry, witnessing their creative endeavors unfold."},

After looking up the film production company, I am into what they're all about regarding centering hispanic actors and voices in their indie films. I think that was a cool part of the film, as well as features from big time Hispanic composer, Emilio Estefan. Better to spend your time and money watching an independent film trying to get their start in the industry as opposed to Bezos lol."},

In a confusing turn of events, they join forces with a group of equally sadistic individuals, each characterized by generic and predictable personalities, such as a demolitions expert or a self-destructive barbarian who oddly adheres to Norse mythology. Their rash actions include planning a daring escape from a mental institution. The filmmakers seem to have completely missed the essence of iconic films like \"Bonnie and Clyde,\" as this misguided attempt at a spin-off fails to induce any impression of seriousness. The screenplay lacks any coherent structure, leaving viewers without anything or anyone to invest in or care about. The story itself is so ridiculous that it becomes impossible to be genuinely offended by the actions of the characters, no matter how many innocent lives they claim. Even the choice of music for certain scenes completely misses the point. Intensifying the issue are the annoying performances that do no justice to the characters they portray. Every line of dialogue feels forced and is poorly delivered. No need to say: do yourself a favor and skip this one. Or, if you want to know how good another movie can be, go and watch this one. You will appreciate other movies more. But this one is so ridiculous, no words to describe it properly (without getting banned from IMDB). 1/10 is still a high rating for this \"movie\"."},

Her acting is wooden and rushed, like she is reading her lines. And the other actors are just as bad. The acting is so bad in this movie it is almost laughable, and there really is no plot. It's just a lot of random stuff loosely connected. It tries to make up for it with a lot of violence and skin, but sadly that isn't enough.

This might seem a paradox, considering that he is probably Norway's greatest painter and an internationally famous artist, and that he had a rather long life full of personal drama and melodrama, with unhappy love stories and psychiatric treatments, with trips to the art capitals of his youth - Paris and Berlin - where he met many of the great artists and intellectuals of the time. Munch even had a special artistic relationship with the camera. And yet, if we exclude the exhibition documentaries, the previous biographical film dedicated to him turns half a century this year. Is the 2023 'Munch' a biographical film? The director of the film is Henrik Martin Dahlsbakken, a fairly young and very prolific director. In the last four years he has made five other films besides this one - two zombie movies, a family drama set at Christmas and two action films with plots set in the 1920s and during the Second World War respectively. 'Munch' is nothing like any of these, but neither is it like a conventional biopic about Norway's national painter."},

From the first scene, it squarely expands the lens of Asians and Asian Americans from the Crazy Rich Asians mystique to a rom-com story in Berkeley and New York City with unique, yet relatable characters that happen to be Asian American. There's a deliberate intimacy created with conversations at regular diners, restaurants, and bars, in search of love, growth, and challenging conversations. Justin Min brings wonderful nuance to what could've otherwise been a caricature in different hands. Sherry Cola and Ally Miki are exceptional. I loved this movie."},
{"movie_id": "tt14483774", "reviewer_name": "EUyeshima", "review_date": "May 25, 2025", "review_score": "5", "review_text": "Such an appropriate name for Randall Park's hipster-centric 2023 relationship comedy because the protagonist Ben, a struggling Berkeley-based fifth-generation Japanese-American filmmaker, is full of shortcomings that directly impact the people closest to him, in particular, his frustrated live-in girlfriend Miko. How each character responds to Ben with his perennially dour demeanor and obsession with blonde girls, makes this movie something of a slog to get through. Park manages a candid and only occasionally funny job of conveying Ben's cynical views of ethnic identity, but he doesn't allow Justin H. Min room to elicit enough empathy for Ben to overcome his sarcastic self-loathing. The only lifeline Ben consistently gets is from his lesbian best friend Alice played with sharp acuity by Sherry Cola. There's an effective confrontation scene between Min and Ally Maki, who plays Miko in more of a reactive manner, but even that falls short of the intended dramatic impact. The East Bay locations were fun to watch."},

But what will staying in such a rut accomplish? That's the harsh reality that an aspiring but unsuccessful Bay Area filmmaker (Justin H, Min) must face when his plans never materialize as hoped for, circumstances that taint his overall outlook and impact other areas of his life, such as his increasingly strained relationship with his live-in girlfriend (Ally Maki). To address these issues, he frequently seeks the advice of his best friend/confidante, a wisecracking, serial-dating lesbian (Sherry Cola) whose own life is more than a little dysfunctional. Their friendship is thus essentially tantamount to an ongoing exercise in misery loves company. But the unfulfilled auteur is suddenly and unexpectedly forced to get off the dime when his significant other announces that she's moving to New York to accept an internship, leaving him alone in Berkeley. So what is he to do now? That's what he's about to find out. However, this unforeseen time by himself proves to be a dual-edged sword, an opportunity for newfound personal freedom but also a time in which he's forced to get his life back on track, a dicey struggle in many respects - not to mention one filled with ample unanticipated fallout. This smartly written offering is full of eye-opening, unexpected plot twists, but they never feel forced, and they're often quite revelatory about the protagonist's true nature. In doing so, the picture successfully and intriguingly combines multiple genres, including romantic comedies tinged with elements typical of character studies, matinee dramas and hard-hitting social commentaries. Debut director Randall Park has also infused this release with an array of biting one-liners and a pervasively edgy quality when it comes to the true nature of relationships, an attribute not unlike that found in films like \"(500) Days of Summer\" (2009), \"Bros\" (2022), \"Crazy Rich Asians\" (2018), and even such Woody Allen projects as \"Manhattan\" (1979) and \"Annie Hall\" (1977). What's more, \"Shortcomings\" is not afraid to show the unflattering sides of otherwise-likable characters, a theme frequently seen in the movies of filmmakers like Nicole Holofcener. Because of all this, there's a certain brusqueness to the narrative and the characters that some viewers might find off-putting, but that's also one of this production's innate beauties in that it serves up an unbridled authenticity not often seen in pictures like this. Even though this release had a brief theatrical run late last summer, it's largely gone unnoticed. Thankfully, however, it's now available for streaming online and makes for a frank but refreshing watch compared to many other comparable offerings, one that gives us all a lot to think about."},

It effectively showcases his coachability, which is a key aspect of his success. The title of the film accurately captures the essence of Curry's story. However, it's important to recognize that he is more than just a basketball player. He is someone who prioritizes bringing joy to his fans through his actions. The director skillfully portrays Curry as someone who carefully evaluates criticisms, both in terms of his athletic abilities and his ideas, without explicitly stating it. Instead of focusing solely on Curry's ideals, the documentary could have explored the perspectives of those he interacts with, shedding light on his character. By doing so, the film would have captured a more comprehensive picture of his personality. \"Underrated\" provides valuable insights into his profession while also highlighting the essence of Stephen Curry as a person, doing justice to his athletic profile. From a personal standpoint, I believe that controversy is inherent in professional sports. However, for those who appreciate thought-provoking ideas, this documentary intermittently reveals the true story of Stephen Curry. If you have a passion for basketball, Stephen Curry, or the Golden State Warriors, this documentary is a must-watch. Additionally, Davidson College, as an institution of higher learning, plays a significant role in Curry's journey, and the Golden State Warriors have capitalized on this connection. \"Underrated\" appeals not only to basketball enthusiasts but also to individuals who strive to pursue multiple passions simultaneously. This story revolves around what Stephen Curry represents in the world of basketball. The film not only showcases his skills on the court but also highlights his ability to think critically and innovate. Personally, I would be thrilled to see the rest of Stephen Curry's story unfold in a documentary that further supports his thesis. I would also like to introduce his story to individuals who have been pulled in different directions due to various factors or their diverse interests. I believe the film has the potential to be longer or even span multiple volumes, as basketball is a sport played by a man with a multitude of ideas. I apologize if my words unintentionally offend anyone who holds basketball dear."},

The first half was good with all the actions and the pace it was going and the second half i would say probably the worst. No logic and no acceptable scenes whatsoever. A really poor screenplay and a usual cringe commercial story. I think H. Vinoth needs a lot of work to do so, cant find a better film of his than sathuranga vettai till now. Really disappointed.some of the scenes are mind boggling while some are really good. Ajith performance was top notch he as his always , mass good dailogue delivery the look was way too good. Manju, samuthirakani and other casts did their role to perfect. Special kudos to mohanasundarams comedy which was amazing. I also liked the way the story it doesnot depend one character around just like other commercial movies usually do. Overall a pretty below average movie. Worst screenplay story and direction, no clearance. Pls do watch it in theaters."},

Cinematically, the patient film stays longingly on key moments of her life, most typically moments of connection in embraces or holding hands. The music of nature and strings peacefully bind the movie together. Story wise, I found this movie very hard to get engaged in. Indeed, as a reflection of life, memories do not organize themselves in linearly, instead being a composition of moments at different times for periods long and short. But with little narrative to draw us in and care about Mack and the characters, these patient moments of longing instead often felt unnecessarily slow. I give the filmmaker credit for this bold vision and I appreciate the film on those merits, even though ultimately this film was not for me."},

All Dirt Roads Taste Of Salt is not one of them. While it runs a tad over 90 minutes it seems a lot longer. I saw it at the Melbourne International Film Festival where we were invited by the emcee to 'let it wash over you'. Goodness me. I had to work hard to not drown in the many, many shots that seemed to last forever, and which were in semi darkness. Largely unhampered by a coherent script or storyline, this movie had a lovely soundscape of bugs chirruping, raIn and storms, but for me that was it. Once your mind is overcome with trying to figure out what is happening and switches to 'How long has this to go?' mode, all is lost. A number of people left, some quite early, and many more didn't wait for the director's talk at the end. Needless to say I was one of them.

However, it's not enough to carry the project if it doesn't have something meaningful or profound to say in the end product, and that, unfortunately, is what's missing from the premiere effort from poet Raven Jackson in her writing/directing feature debut. This offering is perhaps best characterized as a visual tone poem examining the decades-long life of an African-American woman in rural Mississippi from childhood to becoming a grandmother. It's light on narrative and seeks to tell its story visually, relying more on showing than telling, a noble undertaking, to be sure. Nevertheless, the picture leans on its imagery so heavily that it often fails to convey anything of real substance, despite its visual beauty and some obviously heartfelt sequences in which the principals' emotions are indeed palpable and affecting. In between, though, the sequences begin to feel padded after a while, striving to capture profound insights through events that are too innately incidental to express anything truly enlightening, reflective or philosophically rich. Instead, it offers viewers a biographical look at one individual's ties to the people, places and everyday events that made up her life, a depiction that, regrettably, plays more like a home movie with arthouse treatment. This is perhaps best exemplified by a nearly 10-minute sequence of a hug that, frankly, grows stunningly tedious in far less time than that. I suspect that these shortcomings probably arise from the filmmaker being too close to her own subject matter, given that many of the characters in this story are based on the lives of people from her own family and ancestors. Those elements may be deeply moving to her, but they don't translate into material that would mean much to those outside her own immediate circle. With that said, however, this release is not without its merits, most notably its gorgeous cinematography and beautiful original score. Beyond that, though, \"All Dirt Roads Taste of Salt\" is likely to try the patience of many viewers, including those willing to give a chance to its attempt at an alternative inventive approach. This truly feels more like a film or art school project than something that would appeal to even the most ardent of diehard open-minded cinephiles. And that's unfortunate, because I'm sure there's an interesting story buried somewhere within this material. Sadly, it never surfaces but remains camouflaged in its own artistic trappings."},

The story of how we might not feel as beautiful as we get older and maybe even our partners don't want us physically as they used to is a very relatable realistic theme, that can concern anyone in today's society. I must highlight the performnace of the protagonist, who created her character with elegance and truth, captured the riff between her new found self and her old conservative christian self and managed to play out the scenes concernig sex without vulgarity.

About 10-12 years ago when I still had the patience, I used to watch many of such South Indian movies in theatres. Off late, I just wait for such movies to show up on OTT and casually watch them for such moments. With NBK's movies these moments are taken up to a different notch. 2021's release Akhanda surprised me pleasantly and it was very refreshing to see that the movie had a crisp screenplay. This and some of the ridiculous (yet unique) goosebump clips from the theatre which I watched on Twitter made me decide to go and watch this film in the theatres.

I humbly urge the director to read good books and make good movies not such scrap. Balayya's Dialogues, dance steps are hard to endure.

The storyline is a mixture of commercial drama and violence and does not provide any plot points. The screenplay is even worse, ruining the plot and making it look like the epitome of boredom. The characterizations were childishly written and don't help the story. The music was one of the main reasons for the headache, the background music was heavily composed and filled 90% of the movie. The soundtrack was also badly composed, leaving no songs to hear more than once. The cinematography was decent, giving a positive change to the film. The editing was average but the sound design was horrible. The only highlight of the film is the performance of Balakrishna but couldn't help save the overdramatic, violent film."},

It's clear that Cynthia Erivo has put her heart and soul into it, but the story just has too many holes in it for me. We first meet her \"Jacqueline\" character as she wanders the streets of a small greek island town pinching the sugar sachets. Quickly, we discover that she has barely more than the clothes she stands up in, sleeps on a blanket in a sheltered cave and gets about blagging trips on tourist buses. Via flashbacks we are told of her privileged background in her native Liberia and of a love affair with a British woman (Honor Swinton Byrne) in London, and what's clear is that neither idyll seems destined to endure. The former, indeed, is played out across the course of the film in a rather brutally predicable fashion. Fortunately, she encounters tour guide \"Callie\" (Alia Shawkat) who's getting a bit fed up with the day-in day-out routine with her elderly visitors who just want to say they've \"done\" the place. Gradually the two start to bond and maybe there's a little light at the end of the tunnel for \"Jacqueline\"? Both women deliver well enough here, but there are just too many elements missing or under-developed. How did she get here for a start? Too much of her trauma has to be assumed or guessed at and not that I wanted graphic scenes, I did want to know a little more about just what made \"Jacqueline\" tick. The production is all adequate, and for a while the repetitive photography serves well to illustrate the dead-end nature of her existence, but I just think this missed an opportunity to develop the story of \"Jacqueline\" a bit more comprehensively."},

Horror films are continuing to flood into cinemas, and with that, we've gotten a slew of standout scary movies. But we must take the bad with the good, and conversely, there has also been an increase in junk like this. There were a total of two, maybe three scenes that offered me something incrementally above unwatchable. The opening credit sequence was nicely arranged, but I think it's safe to say that the opening credits should not be the high point of a film. None of the characters were likeable, partly because of the brash realism of the writing and partly because of the shallow acting. The story was formulaic, and the metaphor on fear manifestation was so literal that I hesitate to even call it a metaphor. Oh well, it's films like this that'll deepen my appreciation for the more refined horror projects I'm sure to see in the future."},

They didn't follow the original plot of the movie, the acting was all over the place, the scenes clashed, the logic was absolutely nonexistent. Adding the sudden religious savior complex at the end totally killed it for my family. It came out of nowhere and ruined the classic indie vibe. It was unoriginal and bland, and seemed to follow the classic horror sequence. Regret."},

It's not for everyone, and certainly was not the best writing or acting, but It had a clear and engaging storyline and narrative.

The script is messy. Character development is nonexistant. The symbolism is as subtle as a baseball bat. Not even the actors give believable performances. Part of that could be attributed to the abyssmal script, but part can also be directed to a director who has yet to prove they have any idea of what makes an enjoyable movie.

I stay away from \"end times, because technically, we've been in the end times since Christ ascended from the Mount of Olives. Contrary to what one person wants you to believe, there is no racism. In fact, the movie makes a strong case for racial harmony and unity. \"Rise of the Antichrist\" takes current events and suggests how the ease with which people gave up freedoms and critical thinking could return with much more dire consequences. This is the way it COULD happen, not necessarily WILL happen. This is much better than many Christian movies, and you may even consider looking for it on a streaming platform.

If you agree that a spy can be emotional, can fall in love, get married and continue spying in that country then this movie is for you. The movie has a long runtime and maybe the long winded story required it. It is to the credit of the screen writer and the director that the story moves smoothly though there may be technical inaccuracies because it is based on real events. To me the depiction of events during the period 1970s like the 71 war, Pokharan nuclear blast, Prime Minister Bhutto's tirade, takeover of Pakistan government by General Zia, PM Indira Gandhi's emergency etc are fairly well covered. How the spy manages to locate the clandestine nuclear facility in Pakistan overcoming obstacles forms the plot.

Very nice movie based on real life story and heroism. A must watch. A big thumbs-up to the makers. It's a complete family entertainer. If you loved movies like Raazi, Uri etc. This is something you will enjoy. It has some obvious story line, some cinematic liberties but to think that this could be a real life story is chilling. The story is gripping right from the beginning and no where does the movie loses its pace. Dialogues are carefully thought out and will make you think more than what is said."},

I watched this film yesterday, which is captivating from beginning to end. Siddharth is often a formidable contender for the role of army officer. There is a fantastic Bollywood film on Netflix. Mission Majnu, a spy thriller, is inspired by genuine occurrences. You will feel a range of emotions, including a strong sense of patriotism. Songs are pretty honest. Except for Siddhartha, who occasionally overacted, the performers demonstrated remarkable character development. What a film; it is definitely made for the theater, but it also looks great on ott. Another great performance from this person."},

Although film didn't offer anything unseen for an undercover raw agent movie (refer D Day (2013), Phantom(2013) Raazi (2018) etc) but Sidharth-Rashmika's chemistry, his character's innocence and than presence of mind made it an entertaining watch. Story is thrilling and creates goosebumps moments but mostly predictable. Actua;;y I think we have seen too much of this Indo-Pak rivalry spy movies that we are craving for kind of Sita Ramam .

Two leading actresses gave very solid performances, also some of the supporting cast also did a reasonable job, which was a bit of a surprise because of the terrible rating this movie has. There are also some very well written dialogues between characters, also another surprise that a B rated movie gets emotional and deeply thought on few occasions.

I can understand why such ridiculous fare doesn't appeal to all comers, yet I can only lament that in 2023 folks still don't seem to get B-movies, for that's the only reason I can discern why 'Night Train' has seemingly been met with such poor reception."},

If you've seen enough dog movies you know what you're in for. Also, it's your doggie you can train it and raise it however you want. As long as they're loved and cared for everything else falls into place. My dogs (2 very healthy happy dogs) were never properly trained and they're the happiest dogs. So do and raise your dogs as you wish and give them all the love:)"},

In a way... the dog is a backdrop. I am a dog lover and have lost one that was very close to me... so I am a ready made sucker. BUT this film covers about 4 stories... it has good acting... has very good production quality... and good character development. This was an easy film for Rob Lowe... but I think he did a great job. It does pull at the heart strings... and it did get to me a couple of times.... but I don't think it was over done. Most definitely an all family film... rare these days... but I'm a grown man and I enjoyed it. I don't think it's more than a 6... but I gave it a 7 to counterbalance those with a grievance or just a bad heart. And a good 6 is not bad."},

Add to that, it's convenient writing with an entire state joining to help look for the dog.

The story moves all over without creating bare minimum tension considering they had to find Gonker before 20 days."},

It's a delightful family movie that revolves around a family's search for their lost dog. The movie introduces the family and their beloved pet Gonker. Although the plot was somewhat predictable, the charming cast and adorable canine characters made the movie engaging and enjoyable. However, I feel that the underlying message of the story, which is about how the situation brought the parent and child closer, could have been portrayed more strongly. Despite this minor drawback, I would still highly recommend \"Dog Gone\" to anyone who loves family movies with a touch of adventure and heartwarming moments."},

I would have wanted to also see the ordeals of the dog Gronker but alas it was not to be. I also hate it that the trailer was misleading us, thinking the father was not fan of the dog the son brought home when in fact he loved that dog as much as the son. Why do they do that with trailers. Anyway whoopie, I reached the minimum character limit. Dog Gone is a good old feel good family movie. It's fine, just wished to see more dog in it."},

They spent too much time setting the stage and didn't hit the plot points on time. The first half of the movie was boring but the second half picked up.

Veerayya, a fisherman, tracks down a gangster called Micheal to take revenge. The writing is simply written, which can be a one-pager, and has the main commercial elements that any Indian movie would have and focuses on the characterizations of the leading actors. The screenplay was plain and mediocre, giving predictability to the story on screen. Not much weight was given to the story or the screenplay. The direction was also done in a regular manner, not giving any new nuances or surprise factors. The characterization of the lead actor's character was designed well, which is one of the biggest highlights of the movie. The action sequences have above average, and the interval sequence has stood out. The performances done by the principles cast were well done, especially Chiranjeevi's performance, which was outdone for his character and lifted up the film. Ravi Teja's presence stands out and so does his performance. The cinematography was well done, which was outstanding in some scenes. The music was averagely done and was placed in the wrong order.

But of course, there's always villains to add a little tension to the movie and they were appropriately exaggerated and done well.

It explores the conflict between Jem's growing awareness of her body and its needs and the beliefs of the fundamentalist church that plays a large part in her life and her family's life. Her family is also a source of conflict: before his conversion, her father had been a musician with a steady gig at a bar in Memphis, and the temptations of sex, drugs, and rock 'n' roll return after the suicide of one of his former band members. What music is for her father, dance is for Jem and she contrives to lead the church's dance troupe by charming Owen, the church's youth pastor who has just returned from Puerto Rico. Eventually, Owen and Jem begin an affair that is transgressive in almost every possible way: Owen is married, he is the brother of Ben, who is officially courting Jem, and both Owen and Ben are the sons of the church's pastor. The ending is pleasantly ambiguous: we see that Jem follows her powerful need to know about the world and what her place in it ought to be, but not exactly where that takes her."},

Opening up on a dance performance in front of their congregation, Scanlen's immediately reprimanded for having her bra showing through her dance top. We then go into her family life where her brethren are many & her parents, For All Mankind Wren Schmidt & Jimmi Simpson, rule the roost w/iron fists. Into this dynamic comes a new visitor in the form of the pastor's, Homicide's Kyle Secor, son, Lewis Pullman, which raises Scanlen's ardor even though he's already married & his wife is pregnant. Simpson, who used to be in a 'regular' band, falls off the wagon due to his own pressures which when the reveal comes about Pullman & Scanlen's clutch prompts the parents to force her to quit the dance troupe which puts the couple in panic mode (Pullman declares his separation from his wife) & running off happily into the sunset or will they? Writer/director Laurel Parmet captures a potent tale of the flyover states where maybe the standard trajectory of one's community may not be for all w/Scanlen, who continues to impress in her performances (check her out in the HBO limited series Sharp Objects), who carries the weight of the narrative on her ample shoulders abetted by strong support from the other players."},

That's a tricky question, especially for those who are going through the coming of age process. It can be even more confounding for those who are part of a community that demands rigid conformity on an array of fronts. So it is for 17-year-old Jem Starling (Eliza Scanlen), a questioning young woman from a small Kentucky fundamentalist community. She wants to fit in, but she also endeavors to know herself, a quest that carries with it some puzzling yet innate contradictions, many of which are brought front and center when she begins to develop feelings for her married youth pastor (Lewis Pullman), a connection based on emotions that turn out to be mutual. But what is Jem to do - follow her heart or squelch the burgeoning passions surfacing within her, both romantically and in her other secular interests? That's the story that plays out as she attempts to get in touch with her inner being. However, is she seeking to let her true self emerge, or is she succumbing to the wicked manipulations of Satan, as her family and fellow parishioners try to convince her? Independent Spirit Award-nominated writer-director Laurel Parmet's debut feature deftly handles these themes, even if they seem a little predictable, familiar and stretched out at times. The picture's surprisingly inconsistent cinematography sometimes hampers the flow of the narrative, too, with some scenes that are beautifully shot and others that are needlessly and almost indecipherably dark (atmosphere is one thing, but the patent mishandling of this element is something else entirely). Nevertheless, these shortcomings are aptly covered by the fine performances of the film's stellar cast, especially Scanlan, Pullman, and Jimmi Simpson and Wrenn Schmidt as Jem's dysfunctional parents. \"The Starling Girl\" may not be groundbreakingly original, but it reminds us of the importance of being ourselves, no matter what that might entail - and the cost that can come from failing to follow our hearts."},

But there's enough sensitivity and nuance here that I felt like there were sufficient characters, including the lead, who were honestly wrestling with their faith, and the temptations of the secular world. The plot, if somewhat predictable, kept this viewer interested,. The lead was a good combination of the strong, young adult, and the childhood she was just leaving.

I had seen him long ago in his first feature film, Henry Gamble's Birthday Party, and thought then that he showed a lot of promise which proves true. The father has the smallest role and doesn't appear until the latter stages of film and he is a highlight. Played by the Chilian actor Alejandro Goic he gives the film's best performance and has the most touching scenes. A small, but moving film about a hot topic right now, but that's only because one of our political parties is using it to benefit themselves. Shameful."},

The movie should be entertaining to those interested in the modern history of Iran, emigration to the US, and the changes within families after settling here.

Lots of narration, which gets annoying. The main story is that dad just got a new heart, and must have total relaxation. This puts pressure on the rest of the family to bring home the bacon. Leila has even more surprises coming her way! Will she ever get to live how and where she dreamed? It's pretty good! Interesting to see things from another perspective.

As someone born in American to immigrant parents, one of the things I really appreciated about the story is how it really gives the audience a deep view into the life of the mother as a young person and how she grew up to be the way she is now, shedding much light on why she deals with her daughter the way she does...something that I think a lot of films about immigrant families kind of gloss over.

Second generation immigrants-- typically experience. Shireen, mother to 9 kids, is an Iranian woman turned ultra-successful real estate agent in Brooklyn, NY who has to become the primary breadwinner after her husband's heart attack renders him unable to practice as a doctor. While the story primarily revolves around Leila, Shireen's daugther who is a lesbian writer and film director recovering from a break-up with her longtime girlfriend Elena, Shireen also has a vital role in helping shape Leila's self-actualization journey. I enjoyed the flashbacks in the movie that described Shireen's young adulthood and her life in Iran's villages. While I don't think the depiction was very accurate (Iranian villages in 1960's and 70's were much more religious than the movie showed; hijabs were much more conservatively worn; people's emotions were more muted and restrained) I still liked that historical element and insight into Iranian rural life."},

What's bringing all this familial strife to an head is the fact that her father is suffering from heart problems in hospital. They are all gathering around to be supportive and \"Shireen\" can barely suffer her daughter to remain in the same room. Now \"Leila\" has been told their arrival in America was due to a doctor shortage following the Vietnam war, but a casual conversation with her grandmother (Bella Warda) introduces the idea of a \"scandal\" into the proceedings. She doesn't get an immediate explanation, but gradually she is filled in on a scenario that isn't quite as she'd been led to believe. It appears that her parents started out in a remote part of their homeland and that their early marriage wasn't exactly \"straightforward\". What now ensues bares then brings together the threads of the lives of these two women as they both develop the strong character traits that explains rather well the reasons for the current combativeness. A Halloween one-night-stand with actor \"Max\" (Tom Byrne) further complicates things as we head to a frenetic conclusion that is all pretty predictable. Initially, this offers us quite an interesting look at contrasting cultures and generational aspirations, but otherwise it's not really very funny, plays to a load of stereotypes - she has nine brothers so every box can be ticked, and I found the last few scenes really quite annoyingly selfish.

This lack of cultural accuracy is not only misleading but also deeply disappointing for those who were hoping to see a more realistic depiction of Iran on screen. The film's portrayal feels out of touch with reality, as it relies heavily on stereotypes and misconceptions, rather than presenting the rich and diverse heritage that truly defines Iran. Moreover, the production quality of the movie leaves much to be desired. The storytelling is weak, the characters lack depth, and the overall execution feels amateurish. It is evident that the filmmakers did not invest the necessary time and effort to create a film that could resonate with audiences, especially those familiar with Persian culture.

The latter man is more of his mentor, really, and quite a critical, even cruel, one at that. They've been friends since they were twelve and \"Dog\" is a rather shy and reticent sort of fellow that his pal constantly tries to bring more out of his shell. Well, that dynamic changes somewhat when \"Elsa\" (Galatéa Bellugi) arrives on the scene and quickly she and \"Dog\" are an item. They want to be together, they don't really want \"Miralès\" hanging about with them, and he doesn't take that situation well. Despite his confidence and undoubted erudition, he - a trained chef - now finds himself largely alone with only his artist other at home, and his own dog upon whom he dotes. Things come to an head when \"Dog\" manages to annoy a local hoodlum, draws some interesting designs on the bonnet of his car, and faces quite a perilous situation as his gang seek retribution. Things become dangerous - but who can he turn to? It's this final storyline that lets this down a bit, otherwise there's a tautly directed storyline between the two men that's peppered with a lively script riddled with sarcasm and put-downs yet also clearly imbued with a considerable degree of fraternal affection. Though a bit verbally brutal at times, there s truth to some of the barbed remarks as the young \"Dog\" rather aimlessly coasts through life, and Bajon portrays that character effectively - especially given that he has virtually no dialogue at all. This film is also the source of one of the most lifeless sex scenes I think I have ever seen that didn't actually involve a mortuary - and that's quite entertaining.

We learn fairly early on that he and his mother \"Jocasta\" (Perla De La Rosa) get by after his father abandoned them by working loads of different jobs and by him taking on the role of an \"exotico\" - a sort of \"glamour\" wrestler - in a makeshift garage where his job is to camp things up and then get beaten by a guy twice his size. Aside from the fact that it hurts, he decides that he wants a new home for him and his mum, and that he also has the skill to take things a bit further professionally. Together with his new-found, kick-ass, trainer \"Sabrina\" (Roberta Colindrez) he decides to create the new character of \"Cassandro\" to become the first of his creed to actually win! What now ensues is quite a messy film, technically - the editing and continuity are not very good, but the sheer charisma of the star as he portrays this openly gay man in a world that offers him little but hostility is frequently quite amusing and engaging to watch. There's a little bit of (complicated) love interest for him, too, but essentially it's Bernal hamming it up, Liberace style, in the ring where he is adept and pinning down (not an euphemism) gents far more substantial than himself. Like stories of boxing in general, it's illustrative of just how few opportunities there are for those trapped in a cycle of poverty to escape the mundanity of their lives - especially when their sexuality doesn't exactly conform either; and it also demonstrates well just how a community thrives on and values these makeshift, almost bare-knuckle, events. I knew nothing at all about the \"Lucha Libre\" culture so that proved quite an eye-opener too - particularly when reconciled with a strong but not overwhelming gay storyline. Maybe it doesn't need to be seen in a cinema, but I did enjoy it and it's well worth a watch."},

His triumph on the ring is the triumph over namecalling, discrimination, and abandonment from his father. The story of Cassandro, the life story of Saul, and the relationship between the two are so beautiful and all connected, complimenting each other. Very interesting composition. However, 'Cassandro' fails to connect the audience to this beautifully written script. The movie is the process of understanding and empathizing with characters so different from me and my experience. I'm a hetrosexual Asian who has zero interest in wrestling. For two hours, I stayed that way. It fails to draw me into Saul's world and to captivate me to forget that I'm so different from them. The ending is weak, and the editing is boring. Gael García Bernal is a bad choice for Cassandro because he is PRESENTED as too bland, too lethargic, and too old to play Cassandro."},

The film avoids most of the sports movie tropes, other than a training video with Sabrina, played by Roberta Colindrez, who is a female luchadora and trainer. She is spot on as Saul's (Cassandro's) friend and the mother is played by well by actress Perla de la Rosa. The whole cast is great and while I am not a fan of Lucho Libre, the film gives us an interesting take on the art form. Cassandro is an exotico (drag queen luchador) and the film is a tribute to the exoticos that came before. The ending does not disappoint."},

Frustrated where he's at now in the wrestling game, openly gay Bernal formulates a plan to become an exotico (a wrestler in drag as it were) to up his game w/hopes to changing the tune of the establishment's rules of having exoticos always being the heavy in bouts even utilizing a known trainer, Roberta Colindrez, to hone his skills. At first reluctant to break tradition, a promoter seeing the turning of the tide from the audience decides to take the plunge & let Cassandro win which sends him on his way. On the home front all Bernal wants is to provide a home for his mother, Perla De La Rosa, & have his down low relationship w/his lover, Raul Castillo, to be out in the open even though he's married & has children. Coming to a crossroads when Bernal has to face off against El Hijo de Santo (who plays himself humorously complete w/mask) in his biggest match, we wonder if the vaulted underdog will do the right thing by the legend or let his headwind of victories go to his head? Bernal owns the screen here w/his winning performance of a figure who could've gone the tragic route but manages to overcome his status to do things his way w/more than a modicum of dignity w/a well supported cast, which includes Joaquin Cosio (he played baddies in Quantum of Solace & the James Gunn directed Suicide Squad) playing a promoter w/singer Bad Bunny himself playing his right hand man, lending a solid support to the proceedings."},

Looking like some grainy B&W 1950's sci/fi horror film, a genuine sci-fi from the 1950s, even the bad ones, would be more entertaining than this. The story here seems to be about some elixir that can bring eternal life, but told with little dialogue, none of it matters. Actors , who seem to have been called upon to just show up, act poorly as they seem to have little to do which falls upon the writer/director of this fiasco. And while the look of the film is interesting for the first 10 minutes, it soon becomes monotonous. The way a film looks is never going to replace a great script and interesting story."},

The themes of body modification and technology overtaking the core of what it means to be human.

There were definitely things I hadn't seen in a while like stop motion animation techniques in place of CGI. It feels like a breath of fresh air at this point where we are just inundated with things that look the same. It is not going to be everyone's cup of tea but if you like Ray Harryhausen, Tetsuo: Iron Man, cheesy sci-fi movies, you may like this."},

This type of work is so insanely stylized, visually blown out and structurally impenetrable they're really not for everyone but if it's your thing, you'll know it. Stephen Dorff plays the half mad heir to a pseudoscientific cosmetics corporation founded by his guru father (Scott Bakula, of all people) that specializes in life extension techniques with some, shall we say, mildly egregious side effects. When he's kidnapped by two radicals with a murky agenda and force-fed a gargantuan dose of his own formula, he begins to... change and the decision to shoot him up with it backfires spectacularly. Elsewhere, his odd bodybuilder brother (played by that super jacked influencer guy from all those great slow motion memes with the slowed down version of \"baby don't hurt me\" in the background) ponders his absence and launches a hilariously theatrical rescue mission. There's a healthy dose of gooey body horror as Dorff transforms into something monstrous, an extended cameo from Bella Thorne who has still not learned to read a line without sounding just so awkward and it all culminates in a visually delicious stop motion animation battle that would make Ray Harryhausen proud. This kind of thing will always inevitably get accused of being style over substance and, well, I'm a style man myself so my response to that is when you have style this good, the style *is* the substance and you really don't need much else to make it work. Aesthetic is everything, as they say. Well, as I say. This works, if you're in the mood for something thoroughly weird, like a cassette futurism nightmare with a stark black and white palette and berserk full moon energy that doesn't let up."},

Same old typical family business story just to enhance the story director has added more characters to stretch the film and make it a proper entertainer but fails to deliver. 1st half feels very stretched with long boring screenplay and nothing new to add in the storyline whereas 2nd half is good as compare to 1st. Vijay's acting steals the show as compare to rest of the actors because while seeing the movie the director has pretty much involved in Vijay's character and it seems like it. Rest of the cast was average nothing that different as compare to the story. Rashmika is totally wasted. She is there only for songs and distraction. She looks good in songs though but not in the movie. As a movie lover this film is just an average for me though it has action, emotions and songs by the due to long stretched screenplay and old storyline this movie completely falls down. Only for Thalapathy fans. (4/10)"},

So they open up and tell their stories, crying out their pain and fears, sometimes they sing and get out to bathe in the lake (even when it's icy! - they cut a hole in the ice), but most often they just let each other get it off their chest and just listen. By this listening they teach us to listen too, with no judgement but with a lot of empathy and compassion and an open heart. The body is washed, the ritual is performed, now it's the turn for the pain to go. And if it comes again, which it definitely will, they know where to go."},

It's a powerful piece, and the matter of fact way in which they share their darkest secrets is peculiarly affecting. Nonetheless, I felt I was only being told half the story. Who are these people, what are their relationships to each other in the outside world, what role does sauna play in their wider lives, and do they never just chat? The deliberately claustrophic construction of the film emphasises the sense of sisterhood, but are such profound shared experiences truly universal?

The chemistry between Damon and Kevin is definitely enjoyable, and the party scenes are filled with energy, but the film's attempts to appeal to a new generation come across as forced and inauthentic.

Nevertheless, all the cast seemed like they were actually having a good time, and all the performances were fairly decent and convincing. There were a bunch of actual laugh out loud moments, and there was decent fluidity in the screenplay, albeit fairly predictable. Overall, it was a decent and fun one-time watch.

The port city of Astoria, Orgeon is a distinct character within the film, and its laidback stillness is something I grew to like. Several frames delineate the notion, and I think they sublimely complimented the life that Fran (Daisy Ridley) lives. She enjoys her work, but loves running away from the small talk that the office brings. She awkwardly exits office gatherings, including one where a longtime colleague of hers is retiring. There's greater meaning to most of these little moments, but not everything has a meaty payoff."},

Serious character study or comedy? It seems that she wanted both but fell short in both avenues.

I did not know what to expect when I was going to watch this film: is it going to be a horror? (at one point I was thinking she perhaps was getting what she all this time was fantasising about) A huge drama? Comedy? There is some comedy in this film but it is inferior to the overall feeling of the state of being of the main protagonist. She feels isolated from everyone, you could call it depression, but she is still functioning. She works, she has a clean tidy house and she takes care of herself and dresses well. Everyone at her office is really busy with themselves, their own lives, their jobs at the office and the office dynamics. Fran is good at what she does. She grew up in the quiet isolated part of town and this shaped her. She was probably quite isolated from other people, as we learn during a conversation she has at the house party. She probably felt so much isolated from the rest of the world, while growing up, that it became a part of her. Not enough life to stimulate her, not enough engagement with the big world out there. So she incorporated this lonely detachment towards the world and society around her. And no one seems to care or to notice her. Not even at her job, but they accept her. Until the new colleague comes in. They connect. He sees her. He feels for her. And she feels for him, This film isn't as heavy as 'Melancholia' (2011, Lars von Trier) Nor as emotional as 'Dancer in the Dark' (2000, also by Lars von Trier). The pace and the atmosphere, and the sensitivity and the introvertness of protagonist Fran are closely connected to Belgian director, Chantal Akerman's 1975 film 'Jeanne Dielman, 23, quai du commerce, 1080 Bruxelles'. This film with the very long and unusual title from 1975 is about the monotonous, isolated life of a housewife who gets through her days in her clean and tidy apartment. Who turns to offering sex to men, inside that lonely apartment, contributing to her overall feeling of emptiness and isolation. Rachel Lambert's 'Sometimes I Think About Dying' has the same slow paced, voyeuristic, observant quality as Akerman's classic. Never before I have seen a successor to Akerman's masterly film. And here it is. Well done. Of course we are almost 50 years after 'Jeanne Dielman, 23, quai du commerce, 1080 Bruxelles'. We are in the 21st century and Rachel Lambert set her film in rural USA, instead of in a mondaine big city like Brussels. But, it is a smart move, I think. In the 1970's Western societies were way more conservative and a woman, a housewife like Jeanne Dielman in Brussels could live and suffer way more isolated because she was a (divorced or widowed?) woman in a traditional society. The women's rights movement didn't achieve the results we are experiencing this day and age (although many right wing forces are trying to turn back the clock these days). In the 21st century you more likely tend to find women feeling isolated like this, in smaller isolated towns. Not saying that in the big Western metropoles women, and men for that matter, can't feel like detached from life and stuck in their jobs and their day to day routine while going through a depression. Anyway, this is a beautiful film. Gorgeously photographed and directed with a beautiful musical score. Superb cast, really. Everyone is so good. At times the cast feels like a cast from Woody Allen's heydays. You can feel and see that director Rachel Lambert studied the classics. This is a superb, masterly film. If I would pick out one flaw then it is the car scene: too much dialogue and expressed emotion. It is a bit out of tune with the rest of this film. That's why I don't give it 10 stars, but 9 stars in stead. Beautiful film, just beautiful."},

She's very much on the periphery of things at work and goes home to her favourite cottage cheese and bed by 10.15 most evenings. The arrival of \"Robert\" (Dave Merheje) shakes things up a little when his request for some office provisions leads to a trip to the cinema to see \"Departure\" (2015). Though it could never be described as racy, what now ensues watches the two get a little close and a better acquainted. She reveals to him that as she looks from her cubicle window at the huge cranes loading and unloading the ships, she imagines herself swinging from one of them - and not in the way a child might! A chance meeting with the recently retired \"Carol\" (Marcia DeBonis) in a diner might help \"Fran\" recalibrate her priorities though! This is a far cry from anything Ridley has done thus far, and shows her as an actor of considerable versatility. The writing works quite well here, too. Sparingly used between the main characters but more plentifully used to illustrate the banal nature of her life at work - especially with boss \"Isobel\" (Megan Stalter) who has verbal diarrhoea in just about every way you can imagine. The story takes quite an interesting look at those (slightly) later in life who are in a rut and content to remain so but I'm afraid this whole scenario doesn't really make for gripping cinema. Indeed, at times the director seems content to leave us with only the superficial glimpse of the characters and together with the bleak and dull nature of the lighting, creates an ennui all of it's own. It's not so much that nothing really happens, it's that I wasn't really bothered either way if it did or didn't. The whole thing is all just a bit too lacklustre. It's fine, this film, but not much more."},

Both were noisy, flashy, fast edited type films for people with short attention spans who don't want to think about what they are watching. This, despite the fact that both films were supposed to be about serious subjects. Third time was the charm. I was immediately impressed that this was the film I was seeking. It didn't hurt that within seconds I recognized Astoria Oregon, where I spent considerable time back in the 1970s visiting friends who lived there. The people I knew were kind of like the ones in this film. Some were depressed in part due to the often gloomy and damp weather. Some were townies who had adapted. The characters in this film were genuine, friendly, and realistic. It was also great seeing an actress who has been successful in popular Hollywood comic bookish films stretch her acting skills and do something of greater depth and creativity. The film made me laugh with the characters and cry with them."},

The first 25 minutes were an elongated introduction, but even so I failed to recognize what the story was. I ended up turning this off at the one hour mark. As for the character who plays Robert, the love interest, he's not compelling enough to help bring a positive light to this film's murky atmosphere."},

The cinematography and scoring are perfectly set to make you feel as Fran does. There are many shots that leave you with nothing but the environment and quiet background noises, and while that may not sound like a lot, that is a big part of what makes the movie so great. That is the core of the movie, it makes you feel exactly as intended; empty. The story itself is basic, but with the way the characters are built and developed, the story can be overlooked as it only serves as a mean into Frans mind. If you have ever felt suicidal thoughts and depressive episodes the movie will feel like a respectful and truthful insight. It doesn't draw attention to being depressed and suicidal, but it displays the way it affects and shapes a person especially over a long period of time."},

The movie is about Fran (Daisy Ridley) but a lot of screen time is devoted to her environment - the people around her, the city, sounds, infrastructure, etc. It's not a bad decision or anything, just something I haven't seen before. It does help to legitimize and develop the reality she's in, her place in it, and how she feels. Sometimes the best way to show something is by proxy, not through direct depiction. In doing so, you see how removed from her environment she, her disconnected nature, and how she feels in the world. It's done in a very neutral way. It doesn't support or dismiss her position, it only depicts the reality of what's happening in her daily life. I did appreciate that artistic choice, since it doesn't really force any particular viewpoint down the viewer's throat, and it gives room for her situation to breathe in the viewer's mind. Another unusual thing is nothing really happens. There's no catharsis, no real development or breakthrough in any way compared to a lot of other movies. It's more a portrait of someone living with depression, anxiety, self-isolation, and suicidal ideation. As someone with those issues, they got some things really right. The mindless staring into space, or zoning out. The shyness and quietness, and the interactions in the workplace. The comfort things you do when you get home. The minimal lifestyle. The thoughts of dying throughout the day, at random times. And the overall emptiness (there are highs and lows, but it's more of a constant numbing, apathetic feeling). The romance was done pretty well, and wasn't too serious that it detracted away from the story. And even though nothing quite happens, the way it was shot keeps you invested in Fran. You want to know more about her, her story, interests, etc because of how quiet, mysterious, and shy she is. You wonder who she is and how she's doing. I've had action movies where I kept looking at the watch every fifteen minutes but didn't experience that here. In fact, some of the scenes are shot almost like an action/thriller, with cameras lingering on the environment, people, or objects where you think something is going to happen, but doesn't. The music is also unique in that it makes certain moments feel light, even when it doesn't always feel like they should. Overall, it was an unusual movie that depicted certain mental issues in an interesting way. I'd say \"artistic\" and \"unusual\" are the two words I'd use to describe this movie."},

Just me in a cinema and after half an hour I was beginning to understand why! \"Lucy\" (Jennifer Connelly) is trying to have a phone conversation with her daughter \"Dylan\" (auteur Alice Englert) whilst en route to a remote Oregon retreat. She's thousands of miles away in New Zealand and we get the distinct impression that she's not especially interested. That's a feeling that's quite contagious as we all now endure her experience at the spiritual \"Loveranch\". A supposedly tech-free place run by \"Elon\" (Ben Whishaw) that encourages people to open their hearts, their souls and their brains to meaningless waffle about finding yourself. Now insofar as this is supposed to be a parody of this kind of rip-off facility, it sort of works - especially with the arrival of model and DJ \"Beverly\" (Dasha Nekrasova) to whom \"Lucy\" takes not just an instant dislike but also the leg of a chair! Meantime the daughter has an incident of her own on the whacky film set where she is stunt artist. That results in her losing her job and racing home to be by the side of her now incarcerated mother. If you weren't bored already, then the best is yet to come - a positively nauseating tale of family discord, a suicide attempt involving some pills and the shallow end of a swimming pool and, finally, some meaningful conversations amidst the forest with running water gently trickling a-foot! Can they salvage the relationship? Does it need savaging? Do we care? Perhaps this read better as a script, and there are times when I felt the wrath of \"Lucy\" emanating from the screen, but for the most part this is the stuff of a really poor stage play that reminded me again that Ben Whishaw is no great shakes at all on the big screen - indeed, I wonder if he was actually acting at all!

It demonstrates the difficulties of the bureaucracy of child assessment and reflects the struggles we encounter with our own education system. We are brought to empathise with the frustration of teachers, including the ones who have given up the fight against the ideals which teachers no doubt commence their teaching profession. An all round riveting true story with wonderful and gripping performances at all levels. A must watch movie."},

There's a curriculum that they are supposed to follow and this school is the very worst in the land. To inspire better results, the teachers are offered bonuses if their pupils can improve, so imagine their chagrin when \"Sergio\" starts upturning tables and using the school's water reservoir to illustrate the relationship between weight and density. Not only must this teacher galvanise his hitherto indifferent students, but he has to win over his sceptical boss else he's going to end up out of a job! What now ensues is based on a true story and I think could be doing with being shown in classrooms everywhere. Not just because it clearly demonstrates the sheer power an inspirational teacher has to enable young minds, but also to remind kids in better off communities that education (with our without technology) is a thing to be valued. This man offers them a template to teach themselves; to solve problems and develop teamwork skills and to realise that their options are not quite as limited as might have seemed when they started compulsory schooling with precious little interest in any of it. It also asks questions about the rigid nature of repetitive learning and invites us to consider what is or isn't a teacher's place in a community that is historically constrained by perceptions of realism. Can any of these youngsters really aim high and deliver, or is it all pipe dreams? There's a fun dynamic between Derbez and Haddad and the storyline allows us to observe some of the more salient issues that affect these people growing up - poverty, drugs, corruption and family all playing their own decisive part in influencing how education fits into their society. Two hours just flies by, here, and there's plenty of entertainment mingled in with the more serious food for thought. Well worth two hours, I'd say."},

It also asks interesting questions not only about asexuality, but about romantic and sexual relationships in general. One of the main themes of this film is showing how difficult yet significant it is to know what we need in such relationships and how to communicate that with your partner. That is exactly why I think \"Slow\" deserves our attention, because it shows important aspects of modern relationships - that we haven't seen portrayed in cinema before (asexuality) - in a beautiful and intimate matter and how loving someone is sometimes not enough. I must also highlight the acting performances of the two protagonists, that really carry us through this story gorgeously."},

I was most reminded of Shaun of the Dead and Army of Darkness, and thought, \"This director is spot on!\" BUT (and that's a big but) I had real trouble watching Bowser, the actor. Absolutely everything else about the movie was absolute joy, but Onyx himself was a wee bit intense for me, and I found the profanity a bit unnecessary as well. There was a time a kids' movie could discuss virginity (the first \"Hocus Pocus\" does so) but now it might be a touchy subject. I think kids would absolutely ADORE the movie and the Onyx character himself, and even the virginity plot might sneak through as \"never had a girlfriend.\" I hope Bowser keeps creating but, like Paul Reubens, he might find his crossover audience far bigger and more lucrative than this film permits."},

One anachronistic gag is fun, but anachronism galore is a bore, it is so easy, so lazy.

The plot is basic and predictable, the characters are annoying and shallow and the comedy is just not there either. The animal sidekick adds no value of the film and isn't even that cute. The writing isn't the worst i've seen, but definitely not great. The animation was mediocre and the voice acting was sloppy at parts. The characters designs are alright. There were quite afew plot holes which means the movie didn't make sense in some parts. There was also no point to the film, the ending was quite unsatisfying.

Thut was previously a great charioteer but he died due to the evil arts of some racing opponents and he was forced to become a mummy. Nowadays he lives as a simple mummy, however, his peaceful world falls apart when the phoenix bird marks him as the husband of Princess Nefer, who is as little interested in marriage as Thut himself. As if that weren't enough trouble, an ambitious archaeologist, Lord Carnaby, is about to discover the secret underground world of mummies and things get worse when he finds the Egyptian wedding ring. Then, by order of the pharaoh, Princess Nefer must marry Thut, the former charioteer. No one wants marriage; Nefer because he craves freedom, and Thut because he is allergic to marriage. But the designs of the gods are irrevocable: Thut must marry Nefer and guard the royal ring that the Pharaoh has given him. Thut must go to the human world to retrieve it. He is accompanied by Sekhem, his 12-year-old brother, with his pet crocodile, and Nefer. Together they will live a great adventure in modern London and discover something that was not in their plans: falling in love. Eventually a romance emerges with the typical repulsion-attraction. Discover a new world !."},

People and especially children have to know about that! There are a few reasons for this. First, the British government justified the looting of Egyptian artifacts by claiming that they were preserving them from neglect and destruction. They argued that the Egyptians were not capable of caring for their own heritage, and that the British were doing them a favour by taking the artefacts to museums in Britain, where they would be safe and accessible to scholars and the public.... British public! The UK should return these artifacts to Egypt."},

So, I randomly decided to watch this movie, even though I didn't had high expectations about it. Eventually, I watched the movie and I have to say that it was a fun animated film. The movie synopsis was kinda interesting and the storyline was kinda well-written and well-explained, even though it was simple and easy to understand. The main characters were very interesting, well-developed and likeable. In my opinion, it was a kinda funny movie because there were some comedic moments during the movie. Also, I would consider it a kinda action-filled movie and there were some nice chase scenes during the last 30 minutes of the movie. Last but not least, the ending was absolutely predictable and it was just fine. Overall, \"Mummies\" was a fun animated film, fast-paced, kinda funny sometimes and I would probably recommend it to any young kid I know!"},

It could have used such a wide history of Mummy films going back to Universal's black and white efforts with Bris Karloff, then done a mash up with other Mummy films including the one from the nineties with Brendan Fraser, and even the one with Tom Cruise, but this is more about spoiled and entitled kids.

Not sure if it was just my copy, but the entire movie seemed oversaturated which pretty much killed any sort of creepy vibe they were attempting to go for. There were some good moments of atmosphere (not the weather kind) for which I gave it 2 stars rather than one.

It's been a while since I was so flabbergasted by a bad story. I won't spoil anything, if there's even anything to spoil here. The story is so dumb, some kids go on a trip in a luxuary chalet, with all the comfort, open fire, blankets, plenty of wood everywhere, and they still manage to talk about hypothermia whilst walking around in their tank top. You couldn't think of a dumber horror (that's what it's categorized as, you wonder why) movie. They supposedly run out of food after half a day but still have food at the end. Not to mention the blizzard, what a joke, there's more snow in frigging Spain. It looked like a nice cozy winter instead of a devastating cyclone bomb. Avoid this movie at all costs, except if you're a bit masochistic and like to be annoyed for one hour and thirteen minutes."},

The investigating judge \"Rabusset\" (Fabrice Luchini) isn't the sharpest tool in the box, nor is he really bothered about the voracity of any verdict, so long as it goes in the solved drawer. Luckily for our defendant, she is best pals with lawyer \"Pauline\" (Rebecca Marder) who constructs a defence steeped in theatrical delivery that she feels certain will promote the concept of self-defence and see her client walk free. Risky? Well just wait til the second part and the emergence of silent film star \"Odette\" (Isabelle Huppert doing her best Cleo Laine or Eileen Brennan impersonation) who threatens to inject just a little truth into this semi-farcical scenario and upset just about everyone's apple-cart. Whilst all these courtroom shenanigans are on-going, well-to-do boyfriend \"André\" (Édouard Sulpice) has come up with a plan to marry well but keep \"Madeleine\" as his mistress. Hmmm - not quite sure she's really up for that, but as the threads of the storylines start to knit together we are left with a plot that is anything but predicable. The ending isn't the best, it does sort of run out of steam a bit, but for the most part this is a quirkily enjoyable, well-acted, drama that pops a little at the judicial process and showbiz in a fashion that hits more than it misses. It's got a lovely period look to it, the score is suitably mischievous throughout and it proved to be a mystery worth a watch."},

Women lifting women up is the main theme of this movie, and it actually serves as a commentary on today's society. Femicide is the norm in today's day and age, and Ozon showcases with a twist what would have happened were the things completely reversed. It's a statement, it's a an inside in what women can do when they fend for eachother. Although the movie is clearly a comedy, its statement is much more profound than it looks. It also examines how society reacts to criminals these days, where crime is the norm and everyone involved is a star. And it also serves as a commentary on women in showbusiness, where whern they grow older they are suddenly sidetracked.

It was riddled with plot holes, and incohesive and incoherent dialogue. Even the normally comfortable 98 min runtime felt much longer with all the infantile dialogue, terrible humor and some of the long, dragged out and unnecessary scenes.

The wide-shot dystopian scenes are just beautiful, the structure of the world really looks amazing, especially the climax scenes. 25% of first half kind of feels boring but if you are able to feel the (heavy) emotions of the character at the end of second act without losing concentration, then all your patience of first half is paid off. Because story takes its own time to build the depth of the characters and the situation. The concept of the story is definitely made only for Sci-fi nerds, especially if you had watched the Westworld series. And the climax battle is short but dayhm awesome, you will get the vibe of movies from \"I, Robot\" (for robot actions) and \"Terminator\" (for robot design). The second half of this movie is really a highlight, from action to Sci-fi VFX."},

The film is clearly taking inspiration from other Si-Fi futuristic movies such as Blade Runner, Blade Runner 2049, and I Robot. So the inspiration shown is very interesting to see but the film doesn't live up to those expectations at all as the story is pretty forgettable and feels like we've seen the film a hundred times before.

The acting, the portrayal of limitless corporate greed, and the subsequent dehumanization which does not end even as human beings hang on to their last vestiges were dealt with well. The problem was when those themes were not fleshed out properly but rather embedded in the plot. I disagree with the negative reviews saying there were not enough action scenes blah blah blah. I guess folks with that type of complaints have probably never watched anything aside from Michael Bay's transformers movies. The ending is the reason I will not rate it higher. I felt the ending was not quite cathartic enough. It just did not hit the same way and felt like there is more story to be told which as a movie - whether there is a planned sequel or not- should not be the norm."},

While it begins with a pretty impressive set-piece, Jung_E quickly moves into a character-driven, dystopian philosophy sort of territory. The emotional core is the bond between a mother (a dead mercenary) and a daughter (an R&D lead responsible for replicating her mother's brain to develop combat AI). The latter (played by Kang Soo-yeon, R. I. P) is the only character, in this sea of badly-sketched AI-generated clones, who at least tries to make us care.

I'm not even going to try and give a plot description other than to say it takes place in Ancient China and features a horrifically confusing and unnecessarily convoluted plot with Donnie Yen's good guy kung fu artist constantly being in the wrong place at the wrong time. It's apparently based on a wuxia novel series that's rooted in Buddhist ideas, but it's just not very accessible, even for a charitable and engaged outsider like me. I knew I was in for a confusing mess when even the opening title cards were a confusing mess of an English translation. The good news is that the large budget is all on the screen with incredible looking sets and great costumes. Donnie Yen has been quoted as saying this was his attempt to make a Marvel like film using the wuxia genre and he absolutely failed to do so. He doesn't seem to recognize that the power of the first few phases of Marvel films was in how simple and straightforward they were: Simple plots with instantly likeable characters and great action sequences. Sakra does emulate some of the superhero like abilities into its action sequences, but Yen's character largely mopes about the film while most scenes feature endless talking and complications. The three major action sequences we get are pretty good, featuring impressive wire work and stunts, but they also feature oppressive sound design and CGI that feels like it could have used a bit more love.

I always wonder why no one really make it to big screen (i mean with big budget setting). Finally is Donnie made it happen, very very clever of him, credit to him. I love the movie setting, the atmosphere, scenic, choreograph, cgi, pace.... This movies really Donnie one man show, he is the producer, director & action choreograph... For the fight scene, no need to said anything cause is choreograph by him, simply the best plus the cgi really made it explosive. My salute & 2 tumb up to Donnie, hope he will continue make movies adapt Jing Yong novel."},

The worst part is Donnie Yen. He is very homely looking and can't act, and he doesn't look the part. The whole movie is about him and all other characters are played by unknown actors who couldn't act. Yes the fight scenes and cinematography are better, but they are not enough to save this movie.

But, when the financially strapped filmmaker returns to his home in Mexico City, he reluctantly relents on the comic's offer when all his other production proposals are turned down by would-be backers. He thus invites his new writing partner to come stay with him while they hammer out the script, but, upon his collaborator's arrival, he finds the director has mysteriously disappeared. What ensues is a humorous gay comedy-mystery in which clues about the disappearance slowly emerge. At the same time, however, the story also delves into some surprisingly mature and insightful themes, developments very much in contrast to the film's screwball narrative and its somewhat manic opening act. Writer-director Silva's latest thus presents viewers with an intriguing combination of plot elements that one might think shouldn't belong in the same picture but that work surprisingly well together. While it's true that the ending seems somewhat abrupt and that some segments run on a little too long (particularly in the first half-hour), with a few others that could have been omitted entirely, the majority of the material nevertheless holds together well, making for an entertaining, if somewhat offbeat, time at the movies. Sensitive viewers are strongly cautioned, however, that the film features numerous scenes with explicit depictions of gay male sexuality, so those who are easily given to offense may wish to pass on this unrated release. Those considerations aside, though, this is a film that's more than it might superficially seem, particularly the further one gets into the story. It's quite an eye-opening ride into a world that many may be unfamiliar with, but it's also one that simultaneously makes us laugh and makes us think - a rare combination to be found in the same picture, to be sure."},

This isn't quite his scene though, especially when his buddy starts posting stuff that \"Sebastián\" doesn't really want seen. Anyway, Firstman offers him a role working on his new project and decides to move in while they work it through. Silva has a lot to do on this film so he cleverly arranges that with the help of the maid \"Vero\" (Catalina Saavedra) and a rather ugly looking brown sofa, he manages to write himself out of the rest of this, increasingly mysterious, little drama that for Jordan could now be called \"Where's Sebastián?\". Now we all know what has happened as we continue to follow the almost farcical consequences as tracks have to be covered and Firstman vacillates between annoyed to concerned to perplexed to... You get the drift. If you like his style of comedy and delivery, then you'll enjoy this rather ripe and quick-fired look at all things media, gay drug-induced and shallow - indeed, there are few stereotypes left unharmed by this - but it's never dull and though the ending is distinctly weak, I thought this was quite a fun film that shies away from nothing - so don't watch if you've an allergy to male genitalia and beach shagging."},

These are supposed to be amongst the most lethal and devious folks alive yet they all find each other with ease; there is way too much sentiment as the drama predictably unfolds and the underlying ownership of the plot is convoluted and really weak. Now had we spent a little longer with Golding in his one and only shower scene, then perhaps that might have redeemed his otherwise really hammy performance, but we don't so it doesn't, and coupled with a frankly terrible effort from the wooden-as-ever Neill and the almost pantomime-menace contribution from Noomi Rapace as the police investigator \"Vos\" - a woman with quite a secret - we are left with a film that stays defiantly in the realms of a flat-footed and over-scripted television movie.

The plot is simple and plain, it is acceptable and passable at times; but eventually results to be predictable and delivers a 'deja vu´ sensation. The ordinary vengeance story carried out by a relentling young, who finds himself tangled in a deadly conspiracy, while attempting his redemption, but things goes wrong. An assassin, Morgan Ganes (Henry Golding who produced as well), is given a contract to kill seven people around the world only to discover the targets are also assassins who have been hired to kill him. Morgan was enlisted by his mysterious godfather Caldwell (Sam Neill) in a secret organization and he becomes a tough killer operative in Black Ops. Morgan has a beautiful girlfriend, Sophie (Daniela Melchior) with whom he is deeply in love and who pushes him to lead a quiet life and get married, so she gets pregnant. He wants to retire to a settled life, but Morgan is mercilessly chased by two stubborn police inspectors, Agent Vos (Noomi Rapace) and Leon (Jimmy Jean-Louis). Ganes chasing a terrorist cell, and repares to take his vengeance on the mysterious murderers responsible for previous massacre. Agent Vos having secured an invitation to meet him face to face, confronts Morgan."},

The characters are underdeveloped, and the storyline is predictable. The movie attempts to create an air of mystery and intrigue, but fails to deliver. The characters are one-dimensional, and it is difficult to empathize with any of them. The dialogue is weak, and the movie relies heavily on its action sequences to carry it through."},

Sam Neil looks like he couldn't be bothered about his character. Hopefully, there wouldn't be a sequel or prequel this mess of a movie..."},

Was I ever wrong. Henry is not a great actor for this type of role and it became difficult to watch him as the\nmovie seemed to drag on an on. The dialogue was just plain stupid in a lot of the scenes. The plot, if you give it some thought, is just\nplain \"out to lunch\" and totally ridiculous. This seems to be a rehash of scenes from other movies, car chases that are not believeable, wounds that don't seem to be that serious, girlfriend is pregnant. Give me a break ! Nothing new here, just same old , only very poorly done. I was hoping the movie would end. The final scenes in the bathtub and the action surrounding it were just about as bad as you could get. I am so glad that I did not pay to rent or see this movie and got it free from the library. I assume it never hit the theatres."},

I thought this film would just be a little relief from a boring work night; but, I was pleasantly surprised. Very decent plot, nice action that did not try and bite off more than it could chew and decent acting, especially from Sam Neil, who moves effortlessly between being an unflappable handler to a desperate man caught in his lies. He most likely raised the bar for the rest of the cast, except perhaps for Noomi Rapace, who may have driven close to the edge with an almost over the top portrayal of an assassin playing both sides of the street. The story moves quickly, albeit a bit predictably except for the unnecessary twist at the end. Altogether well worth a watch and a pleasant surprise."},

Of course, it can also be designed so that hitmen kill themselves due to misleading information for the sake of money. Not revealing one's identity to the assassin is crucial, but this movie does depict a blind spot for assassins. Because assassins need to leave no trace both before and after their actions, not many people can share their experiences. This also leads to a lack of moral values among assassins, as the film often shows Golding's helplessness and the importance of intelligence exchange among hitmen. After watching the movie, you might feel that money-driven assassins are indeed bad people, without any moral constraints, because both assassins and henchmen who accompany the wealthy lack a clear moral compass."},

I unfairly judged her based on my skewed perception of her portrayal. Even if I had been there, I have no right to judge. The guilt she felt must have been gutting to say the least.

In as much as it's wonderful she has overcome being molested and raped as a child why not use her platform advocating against child exploitation? She stayed true to her desire to be a mom and her love for them is obvious. It was nice of her to share what she did but it was ultimately a sad thing. She didn't deserve to be treated like she did after that tape was stolen. May she continue to find peace and happiness away from Hollywood."},

This documentary reminds me so much of the Chyna doc. This is supposed to show how \"empowered\" she is, but it really shows what an absolute trainwreck her life has been. So if you like exploitation documentaries about sad people destroying their lives then this is for you. I found it shallow as she tries to justify everything. I am really struggling to fill all the required characters as there just isn't much other than sex that fills this documentary. Sorry for the rambling review but I would say avoid this horrible documentary."},

This is the third, and thankfully, final entry of writer and director Edward Drake's Detective Knight trilogy of films. Of the three films, this one actually had the best story premise, but sadly, was the worst directed of them all, and the screenplay was riddled with plot holes, cringeworthy dialogue, and unrealistic nonsense sub-narratives. I'm baffled how any filmmaker can get worse with the more films they make, instead of better."},

Face it. Over the years we've all enjoyed watching Bruce chew up the scenery. Unfortunately not all of the releases for the year were stellar performances. This one being the 3rd, and final installment of the Detective Knight trilogy.was not what I would call the highlight of the three. Starting from the chase scene coming out of the bank, this movie became a giant turd. The dialogue was voiced off camera from the 1:09 mark almost to the very end. What was voiced on camera was out of sync. I can't help but think that they rushed the release for some reason. Surely they could have cleaned it up in post if they had taken more time."},

Its protagonist, Donya, is a young Afghan woman who fled the country and now works at a fortune cookie factory in San Francisco's Chinatown. She deals with the loneliness and the guilt she feels from abandoning her family, which is exacerbated by some fellow Afghan expats in her community who think of her as a traitor. The movie puts a human face on the plight of refugees everywhere. As she says at one point when asked by her psychiatrist if America is all she dreamed it would be, she didn't really imagine what America would be like because the goal wasn't America specifically -- it was just anywhere that wasn't where she was. I don't think most of us can truly understand what that would feel like."},

But who are we to turn to if we have few friends and no family for meaningful, helpful guidance? Peers? Co-workers? A psychiatrist? Such is the fate of Donya (Anita Wali Zada), an Afghan transplant living in Fremont, CA, a distant suburb of San Francisco and home to a large population of her country's fellow immigrants. Having worked as a translator for the US Army while in Afghanistan, she qualified for a special exit visa program that brought her to safety in America when the US pulled out of the war-torn nation. She now holds what appears to be a reasonably well-paying, decidedly whimsical job as a writer of messages for Chinese fortune cookies, but, beyond that, she doesn't have much of a life. She often questions (ironically speaking) the good \"fortune\" from which she's benefitted compared to many of her countrymen back home, frequently experiencing difficulty accepting it and consequently suffering from loneliness and severe insomnia. But what's causing these feelings: Guilt? Isolation? An inability to fit in (or even knowing how to go about doing so)? Or is it some of all of the above? Writer-director Babak Jalali's latest wrestles with these issues from the perspectives of both an isolated immigrant and of a lost twenty-something merely trying to find her way in the world. And, to its credit, the film comes up with some truly brilliant insights in these regards. Unfortunately, there aren't enough of them to make this an enlightening, finely crafted character study. Much of it meanders (especially in the second half), looking for direction through a series of inconsequentially mundane events and a failure to more fully flesh out the insights that it otherwise successfully manages to nail. The film is also sprinkled with delightfully quirky comic relief, but, again, there's not enough of it, which is unfortunate given how well it works when it's successfully and deftly employed. The picture's fine performances, intriguing character development and stark but gorgeous black-and-white cinematography bolster the elements that do work. But, regrettably, this is yet another example of a film that could have used another round of script revisions and tighter editing to help bring the overall production up to snuff, a problem that seems to be plaguing a plethora of offerings these days. Enjoy what works with this one, but don't be disappointed if you end up getting the distinct impression that it comes up short."},

Those images rather set the scene for what follows as we meet fortune cookie maker \"Donya\" (a strong performance from Anaita Wali Zada). She was an interpreter for the US military in her native Afghanistan and has arrived in California on a special visa scheme and is awaiting proper settlement. She can't sleep, so manages to inveigle an appointment with the slightly eccentric psychiatrist \"Dr. Anthony\" (Gregg Turkington) and his rather unorthodox methods manage to illicit some clues (for us) from this rather reticent woman as to what drove and now drives her. Her love life is pretty much non-existent, but a mysterious text message that sends her on a drive might just sort that out - her savvy best pal \"Joanna\" (Hilda Schmelling) reckons that it might! It's quite hard to describe this film. Precious little actually happens, and the pace is glacial in the extreme - but it still works well as a characterful study of a woman who is having to come to terms with some profound changes to her circumstances and to deal with the loneliness, guilt and frustrations - as well as the opportunities - of her new life in a city where her situation is nothing particularly unusual. It's not a dreary introspective, though. There are moments of dark humour (usually from Turkington) as he uses \"White Fang\" to a surprisingly innovative effect. The film is an episode in her life, we have some details from her past and we see a glimmer of what might be on her horizon at the conclusion. It's interesting, oddly engaging and well worth a watch. Television will do fine though."},

The \"less is more\" approach heightens our curiosity about the characters and what they are feeling under the surface of their interactions. Rather than being confused as to their motivations, we can clearly see that these are good and unselfish people, wanting to lead good and decent lives and make meaningful connections with each other without the pretense and personal branding/image crafting that is the prevalent, current mode of human interaction. A story of loneliness and also how to avoid it, if we keep our hearts open and are not ashamed and wary of our own vulnerabilities. The camera work and blocking of each scene is masterfully and tightly arranged and composed, yet consistently seems effortless. Go where this film takes you, and you will be rewarded.

For hardened criminals in the cowboy days, the bad guys look like frat boys dressed up for Halloween. Or, use an excellent face moisturizer from the mercantile. And any scene with them feels like you are watching a middle school theater performance. There are so many corny punch lines as well. From the first 5 minutes it was cringe and never got better. The story line was rushed and seemed like key scenes were cut. I hate to be negative but it's a bust. Movies such as True Grit and Open Range are on a far different level of plot, authenticity, and acting.

The relatively upbeat trailer and the nine and ten-out-of-ten IMDB reviews might well lead you to expect a picaresque tale of flower children and dancing queens, or an uplifting father-daughter love story. But be warned: it is a mostly bleak, often unsettling and largely depressing story. Steve Abbott is a self-absorbed, oblivious father, and poor Alysia is pretty much left to raise herself. And the defence that Steve eventually offers about wanting to foster resilience and self-reliance is self-evidently a crock of ****. So - homophobia, AIDS and lousy boyfriends notwithstanding - it's hard to feel much for Steve, and hard to fully share in Alysia's catharsis when she finally comes to (somewhat) understand and appreciate his struggles, and his neglect. Emilia Jones is good as Alysia. Scoot McNairy does what he can to evoke sympathy for a character that remains largely opaque throughout. But neither the writing, nor the direction is any more than serviceable. To be blunt, there are much better films and TV series about gay parents and their children coping with the AIDS crisis. I'd start with Fellow Travellers."},

That said, writer-director Andrew Durham, adapting Alysia Abbott's memoir of growing up in 1970s San Francisco with her gay father, covers the production in plastic wrapping so thick one doesn't get choked up from emotion as much as choking period on the picture's fraudulency. Scoot McNairy stars as Steve, a gay Midwestern poet in 1974--married to a woman, recently killed in a car accident along with her new partner--who relocates with the couple's pre-teen daughter to free-living San Francisco. Steve willingly gets caught up in the gay life (after, one presumes, being closeted for years), yet this alienates his kid, who begins to feel like an afterthought. Playing Alysia as a child, young Nessa Dougherty is initially filled with amusing wonder at her new surroundings; however, after her father enrolls her (dumps her?) in a French school and she's bullied for having a gay dad, that spark of curiosity is doused. By the time Emilia Jones picks up the role in Alysia's teen years, we've already tired of her (she's bored, angry, depressed--not appealing traits if we're to follow this character into adulthood). \"Fairyland\" seldom achieves the look it's going for (though the stock footage isn't obtrusive). Durham rushes his timeline along--from Anita Bryant to Harvey Milk to AIDS--ditching colorful supporting characters right and left. There are good scenes here, but the message of the movie is a tired one: finding maturity and growth through the decisions we make, and accepting our responsibilities to loved ones no matter how we were raised--even if it intrudes upon our own lives. Bah! ** from ****"},

Two coming-of-age stories - the dad who for the first time learns how to be his gay self while being a dad and the daughter growing up with the secret of her dad's to bear. The film works on this person level because it intertwines the development of SF and gay culture extolled through their own coming of age. Yes, there are one too many set pieces - (the confrontation; the confession; etc...) but the film's honesty, humor, and joy earn these moments of deep sadness and anger.

Michael J Fox is authentic and vulnerable in reflecting upon his successes as an actor, as well as his challenges with Parkinson's. He is fortunate to be surrounded by a loving, buoyant family who does not feel sorry for him. Like him, they retain their playful sense of humor, and it's clear that the Fox family has a good time being together. This film is edited effectively, and the director wisely made a choice in how the younger Michael would be portrayed in a handful of scenes. The stand-in they have for him is filmed from the back, which lends credibility. Luckily, for all involved, there is so much actual footage of Michael, mostly from his TV roles, that the editor had a lot of material to work from. The Director is the off-camera interviewer, who asks pertinent questions, while wisely avoiding the trap of sentimentality. It's curious that the film does not spend too much time addressing Fox's outstanding foundation for Parkinson's, but perhaps that will be revealed in a future film. If you're like me, and have known people who have Parkinson's, there are moments of this film which will touch you, while offering new insights."},

Fox agreed to make a documentary about his life, career and of course, his battle with Parkinson Disease. As the physician who diagnoses him says, \"it's a battle that you won't win.\" But I get the feeling he insisted this would and should be as unsentimental as possible; none of that \"oh woe is me\" crap that drives people to resent rich, successful celebrities struggling with that same real-life crap that we all have to. Michael's angelic wife, Tracy Pollan (who upon learning of his diagnosis, whispers \"in sickness and in health\" ... {sniffles} God Bless Her!) and equally devoted children are clearly his primary reasons for living. But after 10 years of (mostly) silent suffering, he discovered another reason: going public with his incurable condition has increased awareness of it greatly and been a literal, welcome and much-needed $2 billion boon to the funding of research into the disease. I'll admit I was surprised that the punk kid on Family Ties (older than he looked, it turned out) also turned out to be a genuinely good actor. But I was even more surprised and delighted to see him ultimately turn out to be an even better human being. I feel lucky to have lived during the extremely noteworthy life and times of the Canadian actor, wellness activist/philanthropist and man truly with a mission, Michael J. Fox. He is \"da man\"!!!

Clearly this is a man with considerable skill in front of a camera, but his general demeanour and willingness to reflect on the drawbacks and positives of his Parkinson's Disease is revelatory and engaging. Using his highly successful Hollywood career as a bedrock, he shares the roller-coaster ride that has been his life. From his burger-fuelled bedsit, through \"Family Ties\" then his struggle to get film roles, his astonishing success and then to his discovery and disclosure of his illness. It's all presented candidly, amusingly and by a fellow who has steadfastly refused to be beaten. Frequently looking a bit bruised and battered after a fall, and unafraid to illustrate the effects on his mobility and speech, he uses his celebrity status to fundraise for better research into this debilitating brain disease - but he does it without whining. He appreciates he's had a great life - he's a wealthy man with a wife of 30-odd years and four children whom he clearly adores. So many of the documentaries we see nowadays are presented by people who take a camera phone and just use it as an excuse for an highly personal rant. This man has taken the time to construct - from his own book - a narrative that structures how his own (pretty constant) physiotherapy, his dependence on medication and the love of his family give him continuing strength to combat his own demons, sure, but also to put things into a perspective and that I found sad, but actually quite heart-warming. My one complaint is the interviews he does with director Davis Guggenheim. Couldn't he have given himself a microphone? He does rather mumble.

I get they were setting up the juxtaposition of this superstar, hiding his disease out of all kinds of fears, and bringing us to the present. I only wish the story spent more time on the personal side of this. Don't get me wrong...it DOES spend time there, and I know they're telling a story in 90 minutes. I think his Hollywood story could have been told in a 10 minute montage since we all know the story (except for maybe his pre-Family Ties struggle). I want to know more about what scared him (or didn't). DId it ever have a negative impact on his family or was it always \"in sickness and health\"? Aside from drinking, did he battle with other demons. That all sounds dark, I realize, and the movie was intended to be an inspiring story about a man who had it all, and had it taken away by something he learned he could not control.

Fox Movie (2023)' is proof that sometimes all you need to make a good documentary is a likeable subject, and there's nobody quite as likeable as Michael J. Fox. His indomitable spirit shines through in every scene, even those depicting the struggles that come with his illness, and his razor sharp wit cuts to the humorous heart of each situation he describes. It's upsetting to see the effects of Parkinson's on one of cinema's most enduring icons, but the picture's honest representation of the disease is equally as important. It's clear that Fox doesn't want anyone's pity, and the picture itself isn't interested in fostering that feeling in its audience. Instead, it wants you to see that Fox is just as charming, just as entertaining, just as gentle and just as full of life as he always has been. His Parkinson's diagnosis wasn't an ending, it was just another chapter. Essentially a companion piece to Fox's various autobiographies, the film is a fairly basic celebrity documentary at its core, providing us with an overview of its star's career and a look into his current lifestyle. It isn't massively insightful, nor surprising to those who have read the aforementioned books, but it is from Fox's perspective and that's what really matters. Unlike so many others of its kind, it tells its tale from the inside. It isn't interested in what others think of Michael J. Fox's journey, it's only interested in what Michael J. Fox thinks of his journey. Because of this and its subject's absolute integrity, it's a very wholesome and heartfelt affair. Its use of archive footage is notably considered and - alongside a handful of newly shot recreations - it compliments the various to-camera interviews with its star really well. It's worth mentioning, too, that Fox is the only person given the to-camera treatment, which is yet another signifier that the affair is intended as a true (or as close to it as possible) representation of its lead's life that allows him to tell his story his own way. It doesn't want any gossip or contrasting points of view, it doesn't want to eulogise the career of someone who's still alive or have others tell his tale for him, it doesn't need to remain objective because its very being is predicated on it being as subjective as possible. It's a portrait of a person unwilling to let his circumstances stop him from being the best version of himself he can be, a cinematic icon who didn't disappear when life dealt him a bad hand and people began to tell him how the rest of his days would play out. The flick doesn't wash over the dark periods in Fox's life, but it's overwhelmingly positive on the whole. By the time it reaches its uncharacteristically poignant final shot, it may not have conveyed any real theming or challenged your expectations, but it should have left you with a tear in your eye, a smile on your face and an unwavering admiration for the man who went back to the future."},

But that's just a side show to the main story which is an incredible true story I wasn't previously aware of, and one that needs to be told. My Netflix subscription is currently balancing on a knife's edge, but this film managed to save it from being cancelled this month. More like this, please!"},

With Joan out of the picture, her son Troy, who has never liked acting or the camp, finds himself in charge and desperate to get the camp out of Dept. At the same time, the Camp's two teachers, Amos (Ben Platt) and Rebecca (Molly Gordon) are trying to keep the camp running despite Troy's interference.

Ultimately, though, there's a clear adoration on display for all things theatre and all things camp. Although it's never quite as good as it perhaps could have been, it's still a pretty good time once it gets going.

Which I do. A bit. Right then. The cons first. Whilst the main actors play their parts well, some of the support acting is a bit flaky. Fair enough - this is a relatively low budget film so understandable. Secondly, the script is a bit clunky in places, which doesn't help the actors and does make the film feel somewhat contrived at times - you know exactly how this is going to play out. This is okay though - not everyone wants a challenging stressy film, or a film full of unpleasant, gritty, dark characters. I know I don't. Thirdly, Burnley is portrayed as a lovely town of working class, heart of gold, decent, fair, hard working, honest, caring, sharing, people. It isn't. Lots are. But lots are not. Fourthly, a LOT of the content isn't remotely true or accurate, but you need to make the film interesting so fair enough with the carefree approach to facts. The pros. It's a feel good film for all the family and Dave seems like a very decent chap and that's enough justification to make a nice movie. Secondly, I forgot Def Leppard actually did some really good songs! Needed to hear more of them. Er... That's it."},

This isn't one of those. This is a bloody great British dramatic comedy. Based on true events too. We're up north. In Burnley to be precise. With Dave (Rory Kinnear). Dave's a good sort. Local lad. Everyone knows Dave. Everyone trusts Dave. Dave has a profitable business. Dave has money. Dave helps people out. He lends them money. They pay him back. He's already doing what he's destined for. Going pro though. That's what this film is about. A bloke opening his own bank. Sounds far fetched doesn't it. It's not. It's not easy though. The system is geared against the small guy. Clarence (Angus Wright) is part of the system. He's a lawyer, so is his underling Hugh (Joel Fry). They're the established. The London toffs looking down on people like Dave. They'll take his money though, offer their services to try get him set up, even though they don't give him a hope in hell. Without a new bank established in England in over 150 years, the odds are against Dave. That's what makes this such a great story. We love the underdog don't we. Rory is sent to Burnley. Dave sees through Rory. He knows what he's up against. Rory thinks he's nuts. Dave is not nuts. Let's be clear not only is this a great story. This is a great cast. Kinnear and Fry are excellent. Aren't they always, but together well it's just wonderful. What Dave's proposing isn't just loaning money. His vision is changing lives. Creating jobs, finding dreams, saving lives. \"This is all really impressive\" says Hugh after Dave's toured him round the town showing off his portfolio, but he's got a but. Dave stops him in his tracks as simply asks \"The question I want you to answer isn't can The Bank of Dave exist, but should The Bank of Dave exist\". He's got Hugh there. He's got me. I'd run through brick walls for Dave. Okay it's a little obvious where this is headed, but bloody hell the ride is fun. The north south divide, the elite against the people. It's fertile ground. Clarence is used sparingly but his slightly caricatured presence is joyous, \"Toodle pip!\". Hugh Bonneville turns up too. He's Sir Charles, part of the establishment too and his meeting with Hugh shows us the first sign that Hugh isn't only on board with Dave's plan, he's up for a rumble. Things are going to get messy. Obvious where this was headed? Well maybe, but it's not a straight road. For starters I wasn't expecting The Goa Express to show up, never mind Def Leppard, an unrecognisable Paul Kaye or Sean Dyche! This is a feel good film and it's an absolute corker. Honestly that's an understatement. You might already know what happens from real life events, but I'm not going to spoil it. Whether you do or not this is a truly wonderful film, about a wonderful story, with incredibly wonderful people. One of whom, is called Dave."},

(Okay, if you like football, there will be a fifth: Tom Brady). This movie has the barest of plots (four ladies realize their dream to see the SuperBowl and their favorite player, Tom Brady). Some of the events that play out make no sense. (For example, when they dance their way into the SuperBowl. I'll be the first to say they dance better than I do but the crowd acts like they've just seen Cirque de Soleil not four old broads doing the frug.). But these four pros take thinly written characters and make them stand out. Sally Field is probably the funniest as the retired math professor who loves spouting statistics. Jane Fonda, who looks incredible, is sympathetic as the aging sexpot who really just wants to have a comfortable romance. Rita Moreno is great as a grieving widow with a penchant for gambling. And Lily Tomlin, as the de facto leader of the quartet, leaves the snark behind to play an ordinary woman with health issues that just wants to have one last fun trip with her friends. Check your brain at the door, accept that this is silly sentimental nonsense half the time and remember that this could be the last time we see any one of these great actresses."},

However, it can also become something messy, hurtful and emotionally devastating when tainted by self-serving agendas, irresponsible intentions, or reckless, short-sighted experimentation, influences that can purposely or unwittingly end up wreaking widespread havoc. Such is the case in writer-director Ira Sachs's new domestic drama about a flamboyant, free-spirited gay male filmmaker, Tomas (Franz Rogowski), who impulsively jumps into an impromptu fling with a woman, Agathe (Adèle Exarchopoulos), a relationship that leaves his longtime husband, Martin (Ben Whishaw), unsure of what the couple's future might hold. As time passes, circumstances grow increasingly complicated as each member of this unlikely trio tries to sort out what lies ahead, particularly with the emergence of Tomas's ever-growing thoughtless capriciousness. Some viewers may look upon the story's shockingly reprehensible developments as improbable and appalling, but, sadly, as anyone who has ever watched tabloid TV can probably attest, the events depicted here might not appear as far-fetched as one might think. In that respect, this offering presents a bold, courageous, honest look at what can go awry in situations like this, an account loaded with incensed outrage, unbridled ire, biting humor and more than a little cynicism. It's a narrative that some audience members may find offensive, even deplorable, but, like a horrific car accident, it's also something that many viewers might find difficult to look away from, thanks in large part to the wholly convincing performances of the three protagonists. Sensitive viewers should be aware that the film includes a fair amount of explicit and provocative sexual content, so those easily offended by such material may not want to put this one on their watch lists. However, for those who appreciate domestic dramas that hold nothing back and that aren't afraid to get down and dirty in their portrayals of what can happen, this release is about as good as any out there.

What now ensues is, frankly, a rather dull introspective of characters that didn't really leap off the screen at me. Rogowski can be a charismatic actor, but here he offers us a rather unremarkable characterisation of a horny man who wants to have his cake and eat it. Whishaw is, routinely these days on screen, just a bit weedy and presents another weakly constructed individual who seems content not to fight for the man he's supposed to love. It all just rolls along without really catching fire, it's over-scripted and though it may well have a visual authenticity to it, it's all just a bit so what?

The protagonist is a really easy to hate person portrayed brilliantly by Rogowski. You simply cannot find yourself rooting for that guy, he just acts like everyone is owning him their admiration and love. Ben Whishaw plays the betrayed husband. He allows himself to be directed by his husband's whims until he really cannot take them any longer. Exarchopoulos is portraying the new love interest.

{"movie_id": "tt16252698", "reviewer_name": "Johann_Cat", "review_date": "Oct 7, 2023", "review_score": "5", "review_text": "This movie's faint appeal as a post-modern take on a love triangle seems exhausted by the implausible image, featured in many promotional cards, of Franz Rogowski's sneering Tomas jazz-snuggling up to Adèle Exarchopoulos' Agathe on a dance floor. Tantalizing, but no, the film does not explain how this pair makes any chemical, emotional, or even symbolic sense. Franz Rogowski has a convincing restraint and charisma as an outsider in films like \"In den Gängen\" or \"Transit,\" but here, cast in a sexual melodrama (between characters Tomas, Martin, and Agathe) as a self-obsessed bourgeois, he acts as if he were a guy who manages a cable company by day and was hired for this film because of his eyebrows. That said, Rogowski has little in the script to work with: why any character should care about this selfish oaf is head-ache-making opaque. The script tempts Rogowski into an egotistical flatness, his voice a monotonous whine, whose musical equivalent is a beginner's huffing atonally on a saxophone, alone. The character knows no boundaries. Part demon-child, part mindless fungus, he one minute halts ordinary conversations imperiously and the next shows up uninvited (opening doors himself), babbling needy demands in somebody's dwelling or workplace. Aiming for the top edge of the goal, the filmmakers instead deliver Tomas as a kind of compound of all the silly-shirt, night-scene poseurs in the history of Saturday Night Live, going back to Dan Ackroyd's \"wild and crazy guy,\" Bill Hader's Stefon, and the Roxbury Guys of Ferrell and Kattan. However, Tomas's nylon tank and midriff-baring macrame-top collection beats all of these SNL figures in a race to \"ridiculous.\" We are supposed to believe that a woman, played by Adèle Exarchopoulos, who recalls Monica Vitti and Anna Karina in her voluptuous elegance, toughness, and vulnerability, is obsessed with a sniveling, narcissistic twit, a dying fire-pit of acrid banalities. Unsurprisingly, after about five minutes of film time, Exarchopoulos resonates an odd fatigue incompatible with Agathe's allegedly incandescent fascination with Tomas, and she betrays a glowing concern that the actress, not the character, is in a bad dream: this movie. Ben Whishaw as Martin is such a maestro that he is the only one of the three (in other work excellent) principal actors who can bring himself fully to the script with a believable, developing, pained realization, but the film at large is so full of abrupt, nonsensical leaps of mood and commitment that the whole exercise could be a workshop in which the players were challenged to vitalize premises that make scant sense. Another film that much more convincingly allows the wonderful Adèle Exarchopoulos to play on a plane of \"nothing left to lose\" is Rien à foutre (2021)."},

There isn't really much jeopardy here but what there is, is chemistry, The young Campbell is hugely charismatic and her mischievous but decent characterisation of a latter day urchin is really quite engaging. It's also one of Dickinson's more characterful efforts too. He doesn't rely on his looks and his musculature - he is also delivering us an enjoyable performance to watch as their relationship evolves - and not always smoothly.

And when that happens, it holds its own against the best companies out there. So for those liking blockbuster special effects, this is a movie to see. The background is that the sun is expanding, and there are two approaches to saving humans. One is a Digital Life project, where the person's memories are put into a computer, and with quantum computers, it can make it seem as if the person is still alive. The second is a massive engine project, where massive engines on both the earth and the moon are in tandem, and both are moved out of orbit to another location in the solar system. The engine approach is the one in favor, but there is opposition, and the computers get hacked, leading to a rousing CGI battle. One doesn't watch movies like this to assess how real the solutions might be, just is it entertaining. A problem I have with the movie is that crisis after crisis gets thrown to the audience, and each solution became even more far out. It becomes overload. Being that it is a very long movie, there are entire sub-stories that could be left out without ruining the intent of the story. And it seems standard in Chinese movies that at some point, a Chinese person plays a super human role that no mere mortal could go, and that becomes key. I will leave it to the viewers if that happens in this movie, since there are so many moving parts. And while I understand the role the child Yaya plays, she became irritating with her voice quickly."},

This is a prequel to 'The Wandering Earth' and despite knowing how it's going to end (i.e. We wander), was to me the superior film. The CGI, design and special effects are outstanding at times and the film has a 'hard-science' realism to off-set the somewhat preposterous premise. Unfortunately, the filmmakers sacrificed facts and physics for spectacular CGI set-pieces ('rocket-powered space-elevators' are a bit of an oxymoran, solar storms don't cause lunar dust storms, and when something is 'cut loose' in orbit, it doesn't 'fall'). These kinds of 'scientific' flaws, along with the usual 'sound in space', objects falling on the moon at 1G acceleration, spaceships that 'bank' when flying in a vacuum etc are sadly typical for the genre and might as well be accepted as 'craft' over 'reality' (looking cool is more box-office friendly than looking real). I quite liked the backstory about the proponents of DLP fighting to maintain a project that could potentially 'save' everyone, not just a chosen few, and the side plot about the AI girl with a 2-minute lifespan was quite clever. The acting and direction is fine (and on par with similar 'western' CGI-epics) but the story is a bit disjointed and the mid-credit revelation seems to come out of nowhere (and seems like a simplistic plot driver rather than an intriguing twist). I am a sucker for epic 'world-building' effects, so liked the film more for its look than its substance. Given the mega-budget dreck Hollywood has been gurgitating, a little competition should be a good thing."},

Inventive cinematography, compelling performances, and jokes that really land. Moreover, sublime visual effects, shown in the futuristic production design, blade-runner-ish architectures, and aesthetic visual layout especially upon the moon, which I can confidently claim amount to Dune's level of impressiveness. Plot-wise, despite the multiple storylines and fragmented expedition, the film does successfully employ suspenseful buildups through countdowns, recurring motivic dialogues, and emotively riveting missions, which all demonstrate the directory's effort and heed to this ardently demanded movie (at least in the mainland). This takes me to my major complaint: I understand the profit-oriented intention behind revising the Wandering Earth into a movie series, but as a fan of the book, the conversion of the original's spinal ideology and the abandonment of its overarching incidents have exceeded my level of tolerance. Why does the production refuse to present the already-there perfectly constructed story in the book, which has all of apocalypse, desolation, hardcore science, dystopia, survivorship, conspiracy, revolution, filial piety, and censored love, and choose to borrow the mere concept. Comparing to the desperately rational and selfish characters in the novel, the film adapts a bunch of romantically heroic idealists, as their martyrdom is emphatically lauded. However, has it really been this way when humanity encounters a global crisis? Do the saints actually unite and salvage us? Or do they (censored material)?"},

She's house proud, misses her mum, deft at picking a lock, in inner city London, she runs a bike racket with her mate Ali (Alin Uzan). All highly illegal of course, but she's instantly likeable.

Fending for herself, she pulls the wool over everyone's eyes, social services, school and her own. It's full of charm, which is just as well, as it's a big baggy in places early on, but it gets so much spot on that I'll easily forgive it. Grief is hard to portray, but this deals with it beautifully, whilst being genuinely heartwarming. Georgie lives in a West Ham shirt, unbeknownst than it once belonged to Jason (Harris Dickinson), her dad that turns up back on the scene after her mums death, much to Georgie's annoyance. She's wise beyond her years, Jason has his work cut out if he thinks he can just waltz back in. She doesn't trust him, doesn't really trust anyone but Ali, but she'll need to let her guard down if she's going to get on. It's an oddly sweet story. Well put together and acted with humbling honesty.

It is an interesting paradox that, in a world where our leaders are determined to rule and organize every aspect of our lives (our carbon signature), the best movies these days are the ones with no rules, the ones that break the mold. Scrapper follows precisely none of the usual tropes one associates with this kind of story. That fact, along with brilliant acting and scripting, makes it a standout. The hints of a \"Greek choir\" at the top and bottom of the film hint at the scripting skills the producers could have deployed to take it up a notch. Wisely, in Scrapper, less is more.

Such is the case with writer-director Erica Tremblay's third feature outing about a Native American woman (Lily Gladstone) from Oklahoma's Seneca-Cayuga Reservation who goes in search of her missing sister (Hauli Gray) at the Grand Nations Powwow in Oklahoma City with her 13-year-old niece (Isabel Deroy-Olson) in tow. But the duo's road trip odyssey soon turns into a statewide crime-ridden misadventure not unlike the narrative in \"Thelma & Louise\" (1991). Much of this multilayered tale is actually carried off quite skillfully, spotlighting the challenges that indigenous people (especially women) face and presenting a story with a capably executed, tension-filled, edge-of-your-seat quality, prompting viewers to wonder what's coming next. However, as the story wears on, it becomes increasingly implausible, culminating in a climax that's more than a little difficult to believe, its heartfelt sentiments notwithstanding. There are also some intriguing back story elements scattered throughout that, quite frankly, could have been better developed and resolved. That's indeed a shame, considering how these shortcomings undermine the production's many strong points. These weaknesses also take away from the outstanding performances of Gladstone (who turns in even better work here than in her Oscar-nominated role in \"Killers of the Flower Moon\" (2023)) and Deroy-Olson in her big screen debut, as well as an outstanding cast of supporting players. This AppleTV+ original truly has a lot in its favor, but it's unfortunate that it didn't carry through on its strengths throughout the entire film. A near hit but one that doesn't live up to its promise or potential."},

The story is a tad uninteresting but it isn't necessarily bad. The character dynamics and interactions are solid for the most part. The directing gets the job done but there's nothing memorable or unique about it. The elements of Native American culture are cool at certain points but I think the movie needed to dive into it more. The ending is nice in theory but it feels unearned. I think the biggest problem with this movie is that there's a solid emotional story somewhere in there but the film is too bland to get any sort of reaction. The main character makes a lot of questionable choices to put it lightly and instead of exploring the nuance that's there in the character, the film just brushes past it.

Logic is out. It's just visual appeal, bravado laden dialogues and other such massy elements. The hype and hoopla surrounding the movie betrayed the real deal. The movie is all style and totally lacking substance. Beyond a point, such cinema begins to cause heartache. All said and done, the movie does have its high points such as Salman Khan's Tiger character integrations, Ashutosh Rana's acting and John Abraham's svelte looks.

I watched Pathaan with my family and there were multiple scenes that were just inappropriate and unnecessary. Other than that, the plot was super unclear and I didn't understand why a virus was brought into it. I thought we would be seeing something new, as there are many films from the past that have this same trope of a deadly virus. The movie was 2 hrs and 30 minutes approximately, quite a long film but I don't understand why everything in the film, every sequence, felt rushed and like it didn't make much sense. I also found the CGI and VFX extremely fake and artificial, which was disappointing. I know that a team and actors worked really hard to make this film as they do others, but I feel that Pathaan just took advantage of the fact that there were stars like SRK, Deepika, John Abraham, and Salman Khan in it. Would you genuinely enjoy the film had it been some other actors? Anyway, I do feel like I had my hopes up too high for this film. I just hope that Bollywood can make good films again soon."},

This is basically \"Hearts Beat Loud\" but Irish and with more familial antagonism. Is it Carney's best? Nope. Not even close. Some of the Joseph Gordon Levitt scenes were downright laughable (not to mention cringy). But it says something when the moments and performances are enough to overcome all (or most of) the flaws.

Returning from work one afternoon she espies a busted guitar in a skip. 18 Euros later and she has tied a ribbon to it and presented it to him as a belated birthday gift. He's not remotely interested so she decides to try her hand and eventually alights on the less geeky, dashing, \"Jeff\" (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) - an online guitar teacher from California. It's their relationship that gradually helps her to put her more immediate difficulties into better perspective and to begin to find more common ground with \"Max\" and with her ex (on whom she is still a bit sweet). I found there to be a great dynamic between Hewson and Kinlan - though I'm not sure I'd ever have spoken to my mother, nor she to me, in quite this lively vernacular! It's a story that's full of anger and resentment, but also of humour and, in a slightly unique sort of fashion, affection too. Reynor is little more than eye candy - no bad thing - but I could have been doing with a little more from him, and from an acoustically talented JG-L who wrote a few of the songs and performed them - as do the others - too. It's a character study, this film - rough round the edges and maybe just a bit far-fetched, but great use is made of what must have been a tiny production budget to focus the emphasis of the story on the really quite likeable characterisations. Maybe it didn't need a cinema outing, but it is well worth a watch."},

Writer-director John Carney's latest feature tells the story of Flora (Eve Hewson), a Dublin working class single mom with questionable values who's struggling to raise her (allegedly) rebellious teenage son, Max (Orén Kinlan). But, in doing so, the picture tends to wander amidst an array of diverse story threads, all of which start out dubious but gradually mellow into a mass of schmaltzy harmony, a somewhat implausible scenario given the patently unlikable and irresponsible nature of its central characters. The means for accomplishing this transformation is Flora's budding love of music, a newfound passion brought about in large part thanks to her online relationship with Jeff (Joseph Gordon-Levitt), a deadpan, middle-aged Los Angeles-based guitar instructor, a relationship with obvious (but not especially credible) romantic underpinnings. However, in telling this tale, the film gets bogged down by elements like Max's frequent but unconvincing rebelliousness, Flora's turbulent relationship with her ex-husband, Ian (Jack Reynor), and a series of long-winded, tedious, supposedly sensitive conversations between Flora and Jeff. To its credit, the film has its share of biting one-liners and a breakout performance by Hewson, but much of this production never really seems to know where it's going and ends up relying on trite, formulaic plot tropes to wind things up. Regrettably, \"Flora and Son\" represents yet another example of a film that seriously could have benefitted from further revision and development before being committed to a final cut, an all-too-familiar problem with many of this year's cinematic releases."},

It also shifts its focus a few times, bringing backgrounded characters to the forefront and trying to convince you they've been major players all along. In some ways, that's all reflective of the messy life of its protagonist and her journey to re-evaluate and re-prioritise what's truly important to her, but I feel as though giving the movie credit for cleverly structuring itself in a deliberately inefficient way that makes the experience of watching it mimic the experience of its characters is giving it too much credit. 'Flora And Son (2023)' is by no means bad, it's just a bit underwhelming and never really gets out of second gear. It has several strong performances and is generally well-made from a technical standpoint. Some of its storytelling choices are fairly inspired, even if its overarching story plays things mostly safe, and it's paced fairly well (even though you aren't gripped, you're never exactly bored). To say it's so concerned with music, it's perhaps strange that a lot of its tunes, for lack of a better term, kind of suck. I know that music is incredibly subjective (as is film), but I feel as though even within the songs are weak even within the genres they represent - especially the final piece of music, which plays to a crowd who treat it as if it's the next big thing when it's really just... rubbish. To be fair, one of the songs - which reoccurs but is at its most stirring when sung as a duet - is genuinely quite good and it provides the basis for one of the flick's most heartfelt scenes. Ultimately, this is a decent yet scattershot musical comedy drama that occasionally hits the right notes but often falls pretty flat. It's fine for what it is, but there's plenty of similar films that are just better."},

When you go into a film like this you have to understand the underlying meaning behind it. This film portrays a glimpse into a future that could very well come to fruition. It was so well written and executed. The acting was great, the scenery was amazing, the writing was flawless, and the topic was very fascinating. The story was so uniquely original as well which gives the movie this overall art house type vibe. It really makes you wonder what kind of future we might have in store for us. The film also makes you consider the possible threats that A. I could potentially pose. If you like interesting original concepts then I strongly recommend."},

It's much more a traditional ghost story. The acting and directing is decent but the pacing is a little odd... Maybe we need a little more time with the characters at the beginning to care more about what they're experiencing. It's hard to relate to the main character because we don't know a lot about her and aren't really shown any redeemable/relatable qualities we can latch on to as she starts to confront the strange goings-on around her.

We are made believe that the grand mother is evil ( but is she , really?) What role does the grand father play in all this? Without giving anything away there was not much horror and suspense, not enough to keep me from pausing and getting up several times to do chores ! The ending also is very disappointing!

There is almost no visual language at all. Every shot lacks almost any dynamism/movement. The color palette is fairly bland. The lighting is purely utilitarian. The weather is not used in any visually suggestive or symbolic way. There is a lot of grey, dark tones, shadows. In short, its dull visual quality only highlights the more talky and pedantic aspects of the script. It was originally a stage play and it's almost as if director Michael Jacobs-whose background is in TV-doesn't realize that a stage is at least well-lit. This is his directorial debut so I'll cut him some slack (as though he cares what I think lol), and I will admit I laughed a number of times. Macy gets all the good lines. Gere is stuffy and somnambulistic. Keaton is very good. Sarandon is okay too. I think Luke Bracey was the worst piece of acting in the film, and I imagine it's because he wasn't given enough takes, or that he didn't fully understand his character, which I would cut him some slack for because I didn't fully understand him for most of the film either. So, you can watch this movie, but I recommend stopping in the middle to get to bed and then forgetting to watch the rest."},

It was hilarious at first, especially when everyone all arrived at dinner together, but it slowly unravels. Emma roberts character and her boyfriend basically just disappear from the film at one point. The movie just becomes everyone having inner dialogues, with each other.

Bringing the stories together usually evokes interest and lots of laughs but all this did was bring a chuckle, then it was back to watching paint dry. Frank Gallagher playing Frank Gallagher was the only entertaining part of the entire thing. Diane Keaton gets a shout out too as she was fun to watch. I wouldn't recommend the film to anyone, besides recommending to avoid. An A list cast that would have better spent their times promoting the movie than actually being in it."},

I even shed a tear, which is more than I can say for some of the romantic comedy swill I've seen lately. Perhaps it is wasn't formulaic enough for the masses, or the ending wasn't quite wrapped up enough in a bow for every single character the way everyone would have wanted? I'm not sure what would have made it better, but I was satisfied. I'd recommend it for a rainy day."},

However, such are the conditions of everyday life in North Korea, a paranoid, ruthless regime that doesn't hesitate to inflict such indignities on its population and deprive residents of knowledge of anything beyond its borders. In a United Nations human rights report, the unthinkable tactics employed here have been described as being on par with those that were used in Nazi Germany. So it's no wonder there are many who want to escape this harsh reality - that is, at least among those who are able to see beyond the artifice of the false utopian picture that officials have painted of their sorrowful nation. Getting out is far from easy, however, a harrowing venture that often requires defectors to flee northward to China and then maneuver through the challenging terrain of several neighboring Asian countries rather than simply crossing into nearby democratic South Korea, a sanctuary walled off by a de facto combat zone boobytrapped with countless land mines. Seeing what refugees must endure is the aim of documentarian Madeleine Gavin's latest offering, a compilation of defector stories, including those who have succeeded in escaping and those attempting to do so. The latter are compellingly filmed with firsthand, on-the-ground footage, with no reenactments, showing in detail the ordeals they must go through to make their flights to freedom, sometimes successful, sometimes not. In the process, the film also provides audiences with a concise yet comprehensive history of how North Korea reached this point while revealing some little-known troubling secrets about everyday life in this mysterious land, many of which most outsiders have probably never heard of, let alone seen. Because of this, some of the picture's imagery may be considered quite disturbing, especially for sensitive viewers, so those who are easily upset by such troubling visuals should take note. Nevertheless, this BAFTA Award-nominated release is an important piece of filmmaking that those outside this inscrutable enclave should know about - and hope that the world can help to overcome."},

It principally follows one particular family who must travel, at great peril to themselves, their guides and \"brokers\" across the Yalu river into China before continuing through Vietnam, Laos and hopefully across the Mekong into the safety of Thailand. Along the way, though, we are also introduced to other people with equally horrendous stories to tell of family stuck in a nation where malnutrition is rife, clean water is scarce and you are even expected to provide your own poo to the government for use as fertiliser! You must regularly dust your obligatorily hung photos of the \"Dear Leader\" else you're in for a severe beating... Indeed, for much of this film of all that's dystopian about life there, you could be forgiven for thinking it was all a figment in the mind of some fiction writer - except, I doubt they could make it up! There's a strong testament to the perseverance and resilience of the travellers - young and old - as they struggle with the fear and the jungle to make good their escape. What we see here is that, clearly, this is no walk in the park and it seems to me that many more don't make it than do - and that those who did were shocked by the false messages being conveyed to the outside world by their erstwhile leaders. The intimate nature of the photography and the simple evocative narrative work well here, too, and by midway through I genuinely felt invested in the survival and prosperity of these fundamentally decent people who were just \"born in the wrong country\""},

Film kept you on the edge of your seat as you follow the lives of actual people attempting to escape North Korea. Film is intermixed with lots of good and shocking commentary of what daily life is really like in North Korea. Hard to believe that a country like that can still exist in the 21st century.

The fact that any of us can go on with our lives after watching this movie is a shocking point to think about.

The illustration that completes the places where the camera did not collect evidence is a subtle and smart presence. There is no doubt that I will carry this film inside me for many days to come. Social cinema is an activity that we should all embrace with love. There are cases like in this case, that the film is all that can be done and therefore its distribution is so important. Our world is undergoing an alarming change, and by watching such a film, we leave our consciousness compassionate, aware and alert."},

In 1910, Japan colonized unified Korea. But that colonization was brutal. During 35 years of colonization, both Korean culture and language for next were nearly eradicated! After world war II, Japan lost control over Korea and country got divided. The US controlled South Korea, while the Soviet Union controlled North Korea. In 1950, Kim Il-sung attacked South Korea, starting the Korean War, which lasted 3 years and resulted in 5 million deaths. An armistice was signed in July 1953, with no clear victor. The border with South Korea is heavily militarized, with around 2 million landmines in place."},

The film's satire occasionally teeters on the edge of parody as it portrays the Vuvv as whimsical and amusing visitors rather than imposing invaders. The story follows teenager Adam Campbell in a world where the Vuvv have left humanity financially distressed and creatively stifled. While the film has an inventive premise, it struggles with an overabundance of ideas and tonal inconsistency. The characters are emotionally detached, making it hard to connect with them. Despite its promise, the film often falls short in delivering a deep exploration of its themes. The portrayal of the Vuvv verges on becoming caricatures, and the film's tonal shifts disrupt the overall experience. However, it retains an odd charm and occasional moments of amusement, making it worth a watch for those open to its quirky journey."},

Alien invasion movies have long been a favorite of science-fiction filmmakers, as well as platform for those who strive to caution us to our societal missteps and wrong choices along life's muddy path. Within the past couple of weeks I watched JULES (2023), a cute, heart-warming story about an alien who crash-lands in Pennsylvania and is cared for by Ben Kingsley's character. Going back further we have the thoughtful ARRIVAL (2016), the outlandish MEN IN BLACK (1997), the precious E. T. THE EXTRA-TERRESTRIAL (1982) from Spielberg, the frightening ALIEN (1979) by James Cameron, the often-re-made WAR OF THE WORLDS (1953), and the classic FORBIDDEN PLANET (1956). Of course, this is but a tiny portion of the complete list, but it gives some idea of the long-lived fascination."},

Finley excels with the amount of world-building he puts into this. The aliens are as charming and unnerving as they ought to be, and the human reaction to them is as awkward as it should be. But after all of that, the film has so much trouble closing out its story. To say that Landscape has an anti-climatic ending would be an understatement. There must be a point to the artist, his murals, and the aliens who want access to them. If there aren't, what exactly is the point? If the satire relies on the alien race acting identically to the wealthiest 1% of the world's economy, that's not enough to carry this film to its proper completion. I would say Landscape is not as bad as its worst detractors say, but its criticisms are pretty valid."},

It's this that allows the piece to rise above its familiar plotting and uncomfortably conventional finale. The believably sweet central relationship is strong enough to carry the narrative, primarily due to the witty screenplay and sturdy performances, but it's the extra bits of seasoning sprinkled throughout that really mark it as something special. There's a larger world at play here, one built on background detail and vignette-like side stories, and this grounds the core story in a satisfyingly quirky way. The bright cinematography renders the urban setting with genuine love and the visualised stories with Giallo-like vibrancy. The bouncy editing elevates the quick-witted, ever-so-slightly absurdist humour and is a joy to watch throughout. That's true of the entire affair, really: it's a joy to watch. It's always fun, often funny and rarely misses a bit. It's a sweet romantic comedy that does everything it needs to and more."},

He's been dumped by his long-term girlfriend and is having a bit of a cry in the unisex toilets at the art exhibition of his extrovert friend \"Nathan\" (Simon Mayonda). Meantime, \"Yas\" (Vivian Oparah) overhears his distress and noticing his pink converse trainers (yes, she looks under the door) bumps into him later and they strike up a conversation. This leads to a day together in which they find out about each other, meet their exes (a perfectly played luncheon with \"Tinder\" as the star); their exes families and they even indulge in a bit of benign breaking and entering. This shows cosmopolitan London at it's best. It's inclusive, inter-racial and makes no fuss about being so. As someone who lived in that city for thirty years, I rather liked the low key manner in which a diverse and vibrant London was presented here by Raine Allen-Miller. The rest of the story is, though, about as lightweight as it's possible to get. I found the \"Yas\" character irritating from the get-go, and though there are one or two fun cameo performances - an unique rendition of Terence Trent D'Arby's \"Sign My Name\" at a barbecue and Omari Douglas is quite good fun as the karaoke controlling \"Mona\". It all comes across as fine but unremarkable. It's good that it got a cinema release, but it didn't need it.

While it wouldn't have worked if that aspect was shoved down our throats, but the writing is careful when it comes to its subtleties. The lead performances are also great; the relationship equations between Beth and Don, Beth and Sarah, Mark and Sarah, the daughters' relationship with their mother, the couple's relationship with their young son - each of these were adequately portrayed.

That's what happened to the central couple when Beth, a marginally successful novelist, finds out her failing therapist husband Don hates her latest book draft but doesn't have the temerity to tell her. Julia Louis-Dreyfus starred in Holofcener's superior \"Enough Said\" and plays the novelist here with her trademark wit intact.

And in the scenes with Celia Weston, it's like watching a master class in acting. Jane Levy is radiant-and I think headed for stardom, just as Amy Adams was in Junebug, MacLachlin's other film. The problem is that, just as Jane Levy was radiant, so was Setsuko Hara in master filmmaker Mikio Naruse's masterpiece, Sound of the Mountain, which (with no acknowledgment in the current film, and no mention in any of the reviews of A Little Prayer-which was astonishing) was the SAME FILM, start to finish, with very minor variations. MacLachlin's Americanization of the story, moving it from Tokyo to the American south was, I think very adroitly done. 1954 Japan was a very different culture, where the actions of Setsuko Hara's character would have been SO anathema; since MacLachlin's film is current-day, he smartly uses religion in place of 1950s Japanese culture to make Jane Levy's character's same action equally anathema (avoiding spoilers here)."},

This can be particularly true for parents, who frequently find themselves simultaneously loving and becoming frustrated with their kids, even when their onetime youngsters grow into adulthood. Such conditions can be truly exasperating; we can feel for them and desperately want to help them, but, at the same time, we must also allow them the freedom to find their own way out of their challenges, painful though that might be to watch. These are the circumstances confronting Bill and Venida Brass (David Strathairn, Celia Weston), a senior couple and the parents two adult children, David (Will Pullen) and Patti (Anna Camp), both of whom have their share of issues to contend with. Mom and Dad try to offer support and advice, but it often falls on deaf ears, causing them considerable anguish and frustration. Fortunately, they have support of their own to help them through their ordeals, thanks to their cheerful, compassionate, caring daughter-in-law, Tammy (Jane Levy), who quietly struggles with trouble in her marriage to David. Tammy feels more like the child that Bill and Venida wish was their own, which makes it easy for them to return the love and support that she so freely gives to them, despite the life of quiet desperation that she leads on her own. As this family character study plays out, it becomes apparent how challenging these circumstances can be for them, especially Bill and Tammy, who shoulder much of the burden that's been thrust upon them. Based on that, this might sound like a touching, heart-tugging domestic tale, but, regrettably, it never quite lives up to its potential. That's unfortunate, too, given the many strengths this offering has going for it, such as its emotive background score, beautiful cinematography, and strong performances of its superb ensemble, particularly Strathairn, Weston, Camp and Independent Spirit Award nominee Levy. The primary shortcoming here, ironically, rests with the ISA-nominated writing, which never reaches the depth of feeling it's striving for. By no means is this meant to trivialize the issues the characters face, but they aren't exactly facing horrific, insurmountable, life-threatening challenges, either, thereby diluting the emotional impact of the narrative. Prospective viewers should also be aware that the somewhat-misleading trailer for this release makes it look like a comedy-drama, but the humor in the film overall is indeed sparser than how it's depicted in the preview. This latest effort from writer-director Angus MacLachlan, unfortunately, plays like a filmed version of the first draft of a screenplay in need of several more rounds of revisions. Had the picture gone through that process, it might have turned out better. But, as it stands now, not even a little prayer could improve upon how the finished product has turned out."},
{"movie_id": "tt22004186", "reviewer_name": "solojere", "review_date": "Oct 10, 2025", "review_score": "9", "review_text": "A Little Prayer follows Bill (David Strathairn), an aging businessman who lives with his wife, son, and daughter-in-law. Things become complicated for Bill when he suspects his son David is having an affair. This revelation leads Bill on an investigation as he tries to discover the truth while also trying to protect his daughter-in-law, Tammy (Jane Levy). Things are further complicated when Bill's daughter, Patti (Anna Camp), moves back home after leaving her husband. When these problems are compounded with the death of one of his old army buddies, Bill starts to reflect on his life, questioning if he went wrong as a parent and what he can do to help his family. While the film is rather simple and straightforward, it's a great little indie movie. The cast is amazing, and there are some great performances within the film. David Strathairn is an amazing actor and gives an incredible performance here. You really feel like this is a person who wants to do the right thing and protect his family, but doesn't know how. You also get the sense that he regrets focusing so much on work now that he is in his old age. Strathairn also has incredible chemistry with David Strathairn. Their scenes together are definitely the highlight of the movie. Anna Camp's role is relatively small, but her character brings some levity to the film and illustrates just how complicated families can be. I just wish that she had a bigger role. However, I do think that Tammy and Patti's stories mirror each other in interesting ways, which helps make the ending more powerful. Overall, A Little Prayer is a powerful film about making the right choices, even when they are difficult. But I'd recommend it for Strathairn's performance alone."},

The film demonstrates that the true measure of a work's power lies not in the scope of its story or the intensity of its drama, but in the precision of its gaze and the delicacy of its execution.

Jane Levy and David Strathairn star as Tammy, the loving Daughter-in-law and Bill, the patriarch who appreciates her so.

I'm likely the demographic for this type of movie, as it takes place entirely on screens and the lead is just a bit younger than me, but I typically find \"fully online\" movies to be boring, but this movie was exceptional. The clues are laid out but in a way where they are not super obvious, though the reveals with the clues later on are believable. The acting in this film was also much better than I was anticipating. An issue with movies like this are that there is no HD camera, so the visual aspect of acting is difficult to pull off, but the voices alone make the conversations work, and the visuals aren't too bad either. The movie works so well because of its emotional core and because of Javi, the best character.

But I've already seen a few other movies with the exact same set-up, that is, somebody clicking away on a keyboard, solving mysteries like it is the easiest thing to do, things that would take me days if not weeks to figure out. I guess the new generation, that is almost born with a smartphone in hand, just are much handier with apps, websites and hacking than the old geezers like me. Pretty low budget in everything in this movie. A bit surprised by the high ratings it gets on here, reviewers are normally much harsher. The acting was okay for most of the cast.

A simple plot mostly set at a room: after his teenage mother goes missing, a desperate teen tries to find clues on her laptop. This dizzying and electrifying thriller, premiered at the 2023 Sundance Festival, focuses on the desperate search carried out by young June (Storm Reid) to find her missing mother (Nia Long) in Colombia during the holidays with her new boyfriend (Ken Leung). June's (Storm Reid) search for answers is hindered by international red tape. Stuck thousands of miles away in Los Angeles, June creatively uses all the latest technology at her fingertips to try to find her before it's too late. But, as she digs deeper, her digital sleuthing raises more questions than answers,... and, when June unravels secrets about her mom, she discovers that she never really knew her at all. How much do we know our closest people?. No one disappears without a trace!. He just missed his daughter's final call. June's daughter is missing.

Even the story, albeit nothing revolutionary except for the way it was told mostly via screenlife format, had way too many plot and technical issues in the writing. Also, maybe due to the inexperience of the filmmakers to direct their cast properly, I only found Joaquim de Almeida as Javi to be the most believable character, then in a distant second place, Nia Long as Grace. Even with the decent pacing that made the 111 min runtime fly by, most of the screenlife shots were happening too fast for us to figure out what was actually going on.

This time around, they excel at building up tension, allowing the audience to breathe momentarily, and then plunging you right back into the drama with a new discovery. The script demanded plenty from Storm Reid, playing the protagonist June, but the lead actor holds her own, often able to dig deep for the emotionally rich scenes, which tend to come regularly in a movie depicting a voracious girl in a race against time to find her missing mother. But just as important as any actor on the silver screen is the score in the background, and Julian Scherle's score quickly caught my attention and brilliantly helped develop the atmosphere. Although there are aspects of the film that can be considered implausible, I find it difficult to hold that against it. The main character is virtually a Sherlock Holmes-level sleuth, not to mention her uncanny ability to operate a computer at the speed of light. Yet the movie requires those two plot devices in order to move forward. I went into this film with tempered expectations, but I think Johnson and Merrick are starting to get the hang of this fully computer-based movie subgenre."},

Oddly, the pair are no-shows and soon she is caught in a mystery that could involve kidnapping and the FBI as the young woman tries to find out just where \"Grace\" and \"Kevin\" have gone! What now ensues is actually quite a scarily effective treatise on just how easy it is for an internet-savvy teenager to use some fairly basic navigational skills and a fair degree of common sense too use the web to acquire a comprehensive knowledge of the missing couple. For me, too much of this happens on hard to follow busy laptop or phone screens, and the story itself has one or two pretty substantial holes - those becoming annoyingly evident and implausible as the plot develops. Still, it's a decent effort from Reid and is an effectively paced drama that just about keeps the interest for the almost two hours it takes us to reach the really rather convoluted and far-fetched resolution."},

This film seems to comparatively allude that its okay to conclude all drivers must be road ragers based solely on the fact that one driver just side swiped you. What?!? There is ZERO reason for Amira to be so incredibly disrespectful the entire movie. Like your BF is trying to help you by calling a friend and that warranted her tongue lashing in return? Thats not reality. People call in favors for people all the time. Amira is Amira's own worst enemy. Her attitude, her facial expressions, her everything was no no nopety nope for me. Then we have Eddie Murphy's attitude. They were just gross. JLD performance was the most genuine and organic. Ezra, kind of sort of crushed it but my gawd, what an absolute wuss of a \"man\" character. It was refreshing to see him behave (how I kind of thought most of us already did) by simply liking what he likes and not apologizing for it nor explaining it away. Thats how it should be; but, then he went and lost all pride in himself. I also found it very difficult to believe JLD was his mom. They look maybe ten years apart in age, maybe. (He looked the same age as his dad.) JLD desire to include Amira was palpable. Yet all Amira wanted everyone to know, see, know, see, know some more, and see again...is that shes black. Why?

Not really but this 2023 comedy is worth seeing for the star-laden cast. Directed by Kenya Barris (\"Black-ish\"), who co-wrote the screenplay with star Jonah Hill, the plot outline is the same - a besotted interracial couple faces problems from their in-laws on the way to the altar. This movie starts with a refreshing edge with the latest street lingo and culminates into a fiery dinner party where the Holocaust and slavery get compared in sharp exchanges. From there, it starts to flatten out into a romcom throwback from another era, but the principals keep it afloat even as the satirical humor dissipates. Lauren London and a pretty funny Hill provide a snappy presence at the center of the story.

In a case of mistaken identity, ezra (hill) and amira (london) meet up, and immediately get off on the wrong foot. But after going on a date, they really hit it off. They get along great, and even get engaged, but aren't sure how their families will react. Their backgrounds are so different. Ezra's mom tries so hard to be politically correct and hip that she goes overboard, and can't stop talking. Especially at the awkward dinner where the parents all meet. It's awesome. Some minor things, like why was hill so sunburned right after the dinner scene? Did they cut a scene where they went to the beach? Right after that, ezra goes to vegas, so they probably filmed the scenes out of order. A couple things were predictable... as soon as amira's dad (murphy) talks about how much he treasures something, we know something horrible is going to happen to it within ten minutes. Great co-stars.... eddie murphy, dave duchovny, jullia louis dreyfus. So many comedy giants. I wish rhea perlman had more than a one minute appearance. She's so talented. Love mo (sam jay), ezra's business partner. Funny. And they keep mistaking her for a guy. In spite of all the family issues, can they make it work? It's fun. For the most part.

But what I liked most of all was the balanced way the story is told and the message that it's never too late to learn and to change and that it's not just one side contributing to the madness.

What starts on day one as a largely intact and functioning urban area is gradually reduced to rubble as the invading forces bombard the place from the ground and the air slowly terrorising the populace and removing their access to even the most basic of necessities - shelter, water, electricity. It's told chronologically, and therefore it's quite easy for us to see the degradation day-by-day as the people somewhat stoically determine to stay put in the face of some pretty overwhelming military might. The fact that many people do stay is remarkably well captured here. Not just those living there, but those in the professional services who stay to tend the sick, put out the fires - their own sort of \"Blitz Spirit\". It's emotionally charged from the start and though there can be no denying it's propagandist nature at times, it still offers us an undeniable video-diary of the indiscriminate destruction of a city where - just like the V1 and V2 rockets - these explosives literally fall out of the sky and land where they may. There is clearly no \"targeting\" going on with the assault. The narration is just a little too softly spoken. Not that it needed Lord Olivier, but it was quite difficult to hear that was being described at times. In the end, I don't suppose that mattered too much for we can easily see what is going on. Ultimately, it also illustrates well the futility of this invasion. Whoever is left in control of this extended bomb site is unlikely to ever be able to make any use of it, or it's facilities, again. It's obliteration for the sake of it - purely as a show of strength intended to intimidate. This is a solid testament to courageous journalism that tugs at the heart strings, arouses anger and sympathy and though never an easy watch is well worth looking at."},

Nevertheless, this is one of those films that has to be seen in order for the truth behind its story to be fully realized. When Ukrainian journalist-writer-director Mstyslav Chernov and two colleagues chronicled the first days of the nation's brutal conflict with Russia, they probably had no idea what they were in for. Working from the Black Sea port city of Mariupol, they captured devastating footage of the relentless Russian attacks, particularly the enemy's ruthless assaults on civilian targets, despite assurances to the contrary. The Russians were simultaneously determined to destroy the Ukrainian communications infrastructure to prevent word of the atrocities from getting out to the wider world, seriously hindering the work of Chernov and company as the only international journalists still in the war-torn country at the time. As the city was systematically being destroyed, the international community had little knowledge of what was transpiring in Mariupol beyond Russian President Vladimir Putin's skewed propaganda claims. But, when images of the warfront finally made their way out of Ukraine, the world got an entirely new perspective on the carnage unfolding there, despite the Russians' astoundingly incredulous claims that everything that had been photographed was staged, not unlike what one would find on a movie set. Such reporting opened the eyes of the world, first in media coverage at the time and now in this film, a joint production of the Associated Press and the PBS documentary series Frontline. This gripping release holds nothing back, making it an exceedingly difficult watch for virtually everyone, including those with thick skins who ordinarily might not be affected by such graphic imagery. However, it honestly reveals what the Ukrainians were up against in this horrific siege, putting the war crimes of the aggressors on display for all to see. In addition, this offering reinforces the importance of the work of intrepid journalists under the most trying of conditions, particularly where those wreaking havoc are desperate to keep the facts from reaching the light of day. This highly acclaimed film - a recipient of ample awards season buzz and honors - may be difficult to sit through, but discovering the truth is often a challenging process, and both Ukraine and the world should be grateful that there are those out there who are willing to put themselves on the line to see that through, no matter how treacherous or daunting circumstances may be."},

Kudos to authors for risking their lives to get this footage, and to AT and Frontline for allowing the movie to be accessible (I watched it for free on youtube), because it is important for the world to see what has happened and is still happening. The camera does not lie and this is how Russia's \"liberation\" looks like. Next time you hear someone defend Putin's actions or try to justify Russia's actions, just ask them to watch this documentary and make their own conclusions from the ground-level footage. It is unfortunate that there is no end in sight for the war and nobody knows how and when it will end, but bringing awareness is important to make sure that the world does not forget that the war is still raging, and there have been and will be more stories similar or worse than the ones depicted in this movie that unfortunately will be left untold."},

The arrival of new psychologist \"Rebecca\" (Anne Hathaway) injects a little life into her dull routine.

The first hour is quite intriguing but that sense of anticipation is let down by a last half hour that is really quite undercooked and the denouement, well that is just incomplete - on just about every level.

This movie strides through the genres: from lesbian romance akin to Carol to Classic Noir to Horror, even a touch of Hitchcock with a soupcon of Black Comedy. Massachusetts, early 1960s Eileen (Thomasin McKenzie) is a young secretary in a juvenile prison, she's lonely, dreams of love with one of the young guards, is fascinated by an inmate Lee Polk who killed his father, the Polk family are central to the unfolding of the narrative. Eileen looks after her alcoholic ex-cop father, he's verbally abusive but some of this might be designed to drive hr away to her away, to find a life of her own. A new prison Psychologist, Rebecca (Anne Hathaway) arrives and sweeps Eileen off her feet, takes her drinking and dancing, then involves her on a strange and dangerous situation. There is a plot twist at this point that cannot be revealed here without giving too much of the storey line away. The Classic Noir tinged with Horror takes over at this point, Eileen reveals her own hidden depths of depravity. Matching or even outclassing Rebecca. Her fantasy life has always been quite violent and some of this may have have bled through to influence her real life actions. Great performances from McKenzie. Hathaway and Marin Ireland as Rita Polk, Lee's mother. Directed by William Oldroyd with a screenplay by by Ottessa Moshfegh and Luke Goebel. 8/10."},

Because for most of the first 2/3rds I just couldn't figure out where the film was going. Sometimes for better but sometimes it meant that a lot of those portions dragged considerably. The 3rd act takes a pretty drastic change that I found pretty intriguing but I don't think had enough set up to fully justify. It made me wish that the script focused on a different perspective than it did in retrospect. The ending is also pretty abrupt and left me with more questions than answers. Thomasin Mackenzie and Anne Hathaway are great though and every scene that they share are when the film was at it's most captivating. It's also very well shot with a really good 60's like aesthetic. Eileen as is was a pretty intriguing ride but it's hard not to think that there's better version of this story existed in the script somewhere."},

After an impressive debut with \"Lady Macbeth\" (2016), the filmmaker has stumbled seriously in this latest effort, a supposed psychological mystery/thriller that never finds traction and yet somehow manages to go wildly off the rails in the final act. This cinematic misfire examines the relationship that develops between two women who work at a young men's prison in 1960s small town Massachusetts. Eileen (Thomasin McKenzie) is a reserved, awkward, often-bullied, sexually repressed administrative assistant, and Rebecca (Anne Hathaway) is the facility's newly hired, sophisticated, worldly, Harvard-educated psychologist. They quickly strike up a close yet somewhat unlikely bond with less-than-subtle (but apparently never-consummated) sexual overtones, a story thread that seems to be heading somewhere but never does. In large part that's because the protagonists end up becoming involved in a hare-brained scheme worthy of Lucy and Ethel, only with significant implications, a scenario that comes out of left field and sends the narrative into serious, unexplained head-scratching territory. While the picture features a fine production design, a palette of creative cinematography, and capable Independent Spirit Award-nominated supporting performances by Hathaway and Marin Ireland, there's not much else here that's engaging, riveting or worthwhile, elements essential to a good mystery/thriller offering. Whatever the filmmaker was going for here obviously never comes to fruition, thanks to either its poorly composed script or its mishandled execution (or a combination thereof). Indeed, this is one of those films where virtually the entire project truly would have been better off left on the cutting room floor."},

Thomasin McKenzie does a good job and then Anne Hathaway makes a dramatic entrance and keeps the viewer's attention. The chemistry between them is good. Shea Whigham does a convincing job as the alcoholic father. Marin Ireland also has a very good scene. But the pacing is SO painfully slow. That's all right if you are slowly building tension and then deliver some big payoff but Eileen offers neither. So many needless scenes. Eileen almost looks in Rebecca's medicine cabinet but doesn't. Eileen fantasizes about standing near a lake. Why? Who cares! Eileen's character is well-drawn but Rebecca is a bit of a caricature: Part Cate Blanchett in Carol, part Nicole Kidman in To Die For. It offered just barely enough to keep me watching. Then it takes a weird twist. Then there is no payoff and no ending. There were pieces of a good movie in there but it definitely did not live up to its potential. Instead, it was a slow, boring, indulgent mess in need of editing and a final act.

Like seriously, season 3 of Teen Wolf had no right to be as good as it was. Season 4-6 were, fine, not bad, not great. The Teen Wolf Movie is more or less the same. There are plently of great things here and there in this movie, but overall, it falls short on many aspects. It's not bad by any means, but it just feels like 2 episodes of the original show mashed into 2.5 hours. It doesn't feel like a movie, and that comes down to the direction and very weird editing. Being 2.5 hours long, this 'movie' feels very rushed, especially during the first half an hour. We bounce between our old main characters, and don't really spend all that much time with them within their normal lives. The movie could have spared more time to show us what these great characters have been doing for the past 5 years, or 7 years in the movie. Not much happens action wise, not until the last act, but even then the action scenes are very underwhelming. Scott, Malia, Derek, Peter, Chris and Lydia do almost nothing throughout the entire movie. Allison is pretty much the main character here. While she isn't bad, and the way they brought her back wasn't too far fetched by Teen Wolf standards, I feel like they spent too much time with her, and not with our main heroes. Which makes me believe this movie should have been a mini series with maybe 6 episodes. To flesh out the story a little better. What made the original show so brilliant, was its characters. Scott, Stiles, Lydia, Allison, Coach and Sheriff Stilinski are brilliant, but here they feel so under used, with the execption of Allison."},

Seeing all the characters from the series? Yeah, mostly those reasons. I really missed Stiles being missing from the movie because he was my favorite character. However, so many old characters are back and all are utilized at some point. There's so much violence and pretty much non-stop action that there's not a lot of room for more character development or getting to know what everyone has been up to other than Scott, Derek and Lydia.

The back and forth which I thought might create a nice push and pull dynamic, became frustrating for the viewer. And unfortunately the ending seemed more rushed than well-planned. Would I recommend? Yeah, for a run of the mill movie, but will I watch it again? Sorry no."},

I wanted to see something longer, without shooting, killing, with some dialogues and I found it. It has good plot, good acting. There are no forced sex scenes, almost no sex at all but there is a good tension between the main characters. Their interaction is very realistic. It is good fun that keeps you watching until the end. Of course it is not a masterpiece but if you want to spend enjoyable evening, maybe with your spouse, I can recommend it to you."},

It deals with the themes of bureaucracy, gender & power dynamics, set within the glassy walls of a Wall Street hedge fund. Chloe Domont, I'm guessing in her feature film debut, sheds light on the sexy shenanigans between the characters of Emily (Phoebe) and Luke (Alden), a couple who are decidedly dating at the workplace (even if it's said to be a strict no-no). We, as audiences, enter their lives at a seemingly interesting point. In the beginning, they're shown to enjoy a bathroom quickie when she gets her period. They both deal with it respectfully and gleefully, like most modern-day \"progressive\" couples. Now, to contrast this with the almost rapey sex scene that takes place during the climax - what a piece of writing brilliance that is!"},

The male character could have handled the situation much differently if it was a more realistic real life situation. He should have tried to either get an internal transfer or apply at a different company which would be much better for their future marriage. Otherwise it was always doomed to fail in the long term.

It does get tiring watching movies over the years where they do such a poor job of getting even simple details correct. After the first 15 minutes of Plane, the number of gross errors was amazing. A few examples: Capt Torrance is shown hurrying through security to get to the plane, where he meets the first officer for the first time. In the real world, they would have met in flight ops an hour earlier, done the flight planning, and gone to the plane. In the movie, as the (gate agent?) is getting ready to close up, he tells the Capt that he needs to fly a different route!!!??? This would be like a scrub nurse telling a surgeon how to operate. Then they repeatedly show the outside of the aircraft, which looks like an MD 80 series, but the cockpit is an Airbus A320. Later (I loved this one) the Capt dashes out of the cockpit into the cabin during moderate to severe turbulence, thus endangering himself and everyone aboard. It goes on and on. I saw that the aviation consultant was a guy with lots of ratings in various aircraft, but he obviously knows nothing about airline procedures. They could have easily received free advice from any airline pilot and avoided all of this. For example, the current Apple TV series, Hijack gets most things right."},

There is nothing new about the story, but the pacing is interesting. The director could have turned this into a race, a mistake too many actioners make, trying to constantly hype the audience with new thrills. Instead, the whole film is done more slowly, which in this cases makes the story feel that much more personal. A half hour into it, not a lot has happened but the audience starts to feel like they too are on that plane... and wish they were not.

Night Shyamalan fan - in fact, I kind of like to tease and mock his movies when I watch them with friends. I think he often starts off with interesting ideas but, perhaps because of his early success with The Sixth Sense, always feels this need to cram in some kind of ridiculous twist (or multiple twists) at the end. Sometimes they work, sometimes they don't - but he seems to rely on the surprise of the twist to win people over too much. It was a surprise to me then when this movie didn't have a twist at all. I kept waiting for it - but it never came."},

The film sets the stage with an isolated cabin in the woods and a mysterious knock that disrupts the tranquility, laying the foundation for an atmosphere of tension. As the plot unfolds, however, the execution struggles to maintain the level of suspense promised by the premise.

It is a very strange movie directed by Brandon Cronenberg, the son of David Cronenberg (\"Videodrome\", \"The Fly\", etc.) It is about a couple (Alexander Skarsgård and Cleopatra Coleman) who travel to a luxury resort in a repressive dictatorship. They meet another couple (Jalil Lespert and Mia Goth) who convince them to travel off the grounds of the resort, even though it is prohibited by the rules of the resort and country. Soon a tragedy occurs, and the couple is thrust into a fever dream of drugs, sex and violence. Mia Goth is excellent as the temptress who pushes Skarsgård's character into doing things he would never think of doing. Skarsgård is wasted in this role and his character takes actions that defy common sense. And while some have praised Brandon Cronenberg's direction - I found some of the strange angles and quirks he uses to be more annoying than ingenious. There is a surfeit of sex, violence and gore for those who enjoy that, but I cannot say that it really added anything to a convoluted plot that really makes no sense. Only recommended for Mia Goth's standout performance - wait for cable or Netflix on this one. 5/10."},

Fashion model, actress and artist Teyana Taylor stars as the restless and determined Inez. I have never seen her in a film role before, but I can say that she carries this film to a great extent. The film is written by A. V. Rockvell, who also directs. The film largely succeeds in being an engaging drama about an era from the mid-90s and 10 years into the future. The film depicts difficult social conditions, this time the action is set in New York. The liberating thing about the film is that even though the main character faces a lot of opposition and is far down the ladder financially and socially, she never gives up. The film could easily have ended as a description of misery, but Teyana makes sure to give life and commitment to the main character who appears as a primal force who fights fiercely for what she believes in."},

She is \"Inez\" who decides that she wants to reclaim her young son \"Terry\" from his life on the streets of New York. What now ensues illustrates quite well the difficulties they both face as they both grow up with little by way of opportunity - or money - but determined to stick together despite their not always seeing eye to eye. Along the way, she marries \"Lucky\" (William Catlett), a decent man who offers some stability and it begins to look like \"Terry\" (by this stage played by Josiah Cross, but played well as a child by Aaron Kingsley Adetola) might just have a chance. Thing is, as the audience know by now, the relationship between mother and son is not as it seems - and the impending action of the authorities, coupled with a rather unscrupulous landlord, look like the wrecking ball is en route to their dreams. It meanders a bit too much for me, this film. It could have easily lost twenty minutes and the writing could have focussed better on developing the \"Terry\" character a little more, but it's still quite a powerful assessment of family values, loyalty and civic indifference that ought to make anyone sit up and take notice. It doesn't need a big screen - but is worth a watch on the telly."},

But is it possible to carry things too far? That's a question raised in writer-director A. V. Rockwell's debut feature about a mother with a criminal record (Teyana Taylor) who kidnaps her young son (Aaron Kingsley Adetola) out of foster care upon her release from prison. She questions the adequacy of the care he is receiving as a ward of the state, and so she snatches him from his foster caretaker and hides him away as she seeks to get her life together. Over the next 11 years (1994-2005), she largely succeeds at this, too, even in the midst of many challenges, including an often-uneven relationship with her former partner in crime (literally) (Will Catlett) and a rapidly changing New York, especially in her home neighborhood of Harlem. Despite a somewhat slow and unfocused start, the story deepens as this unlikely new family seeks to get on its feet. However, the somewhat-disjointed opening act sets the tone for the overall narrative, which gets away from its basic premise and starts meandering in engaging but largely unrelated territory, an issue that hampers the focus of this story until near the end. These shortcomings are defrayed to a degree by its fine performances, most notably Taylor and the gifted actors playing her son at ages 13 and 17 (Aven Courtney and Josiah Cross, respectively), but these portrayals aren't quite enough to overcome the inherent drawbacks in the direction of the script. With that said, though, the filmmaker nevertheless shows promise in telling moving tales, so here's hoping this start lead to better efforts in her future endeavors."},

His artistic attempts with all the off-center shots - such as an actors face in the bottom right corner of the entire screen, became annoying fast, especially when it came to the dramatic gore scenes, that seemed to be edited down for 10 year old viewers. Even the backstory of the two dads was boring and pretty much insignificant to the core premise of the film, especially when the narrative was based on \"pure love\". Ya, ok, nothing pure about those two in those backstories, that also lacked anything of substance to make me care for either dad. His screenplay lacked the creativity to give the viewer the thrills and shock-factor this film really needed to give it some bite.

It's a good movie, nothing more and it's not for everyone either."},

I do love original films, and early in the piece, it was so cool, not knowing where the film was going, but later on, in the last 40 minutes, we have moments of predicability. I found this a fun shock movie, where we have some scenes. Which are truly memorably bizarre, the final one, a scene of normality, staying in my mind the most. This is one of these films, that lingers in the memory, days after you see it. It has strobing. 180 degree turn shots, a daunting music score, cloning, and sexy Mia Goth, really playing her part to the hilt. One X rated sex shot we could of done without. Brandon Cronenberg (David's) has definitely created something originally appealing and engrossing, but it gets too ludiicrous and crazy in it's second half. Some of the bloodletting scenes, are pretty heavy. Definitely recommended, but be warned."},

Little did I realize that bodybuilding is not what this movie is about. Instead, it is a grim narrative on the dangers of loneliness. Killian Maddox (Jonathan Majors) is a bodybuilder with intense aspirations of becoming a revered \"Mr. Olympia\", willing to go to extreme lengths to achieve this goal. Unfortunately, his troubled youth and his declining mental state hinder his progress and send him on a path to utter madness. Maddox only has one person in his life that he truly loves: his grandfather. Other than that, he has no friends, and no (successful) love interests either. Due to his growing loneliness, he tries to write to his hero, Brad Vanderhorn, but is ignored by him too. This film begs a necessary question: How much can a person truly tolerate being alone before they get consumed by their obsessions and thoughts? The answer that the film provides is quite dark, but also representative of what it means to be human."},

Because of the directions of this film, it's a difficult watch.

{"movie_id": "tt13652142", "reviewer_name": "EUyeshima", "review_date": "Apr 13, 2025", "review_score": "7", "review_text": "Jonathan Majors' devastating, punishing performance is undeniable in his emotional and obviously physical commitment to the embattled character. However, this dark 2025 character drama allows little escape from the real-life echoes of Majors' own arrest for assault and harassment in 2023. Now released two years later, it's a difficult watch, unrelenting in its bleakness, as director Elijah Bynum tracks the pained existence of struggling bodybuilder Killian Maddox (aptly named). As portrayed by Majors, he's a socially awkward, psychologically unstable young man whose chiseled physique and monomaniacal goal of becoming a world-class bodybuilder are at odds with his hardscrabble daily life and his inability to connect with anyone beyond his frail grandfather. The fissures in his mental state deepen and widen at every turn, which includes a disastrous first date with his grocery store co-worker Jessie, a meltdown episode at a local paint store, and a much-awaited meeting with his bodybuilding idol. Each plot turn leads to an even darker episode with a relentless threat of violence, which becomes exhausting over its marathon 123-minute running time. Because Bynum focuses so completely on Killian, there is little acting room for the supporting cast, though Haley Bennett shines briefly as Jessie as does Harriet Sansom Harris as Killian's state-mandated counselor. Nevertheless, if you can separate art from life, it's Majors' show in a complex, challenging role that appears to take inspiration from Robert De Niro's Travis Bickle in \"Taxi Driver\" and Mickey Rourke's Randy Robinson in \"The Wrestler\". They're all high-octane portraits of immobile loners deep in the shadows of their tortured minds."},

{"movie_id": "tt13652142", "reviewer_name": "brentsbulletinboard", "review_date": "Mar 26, 2025", "review_score": "7", "review_text": "Toxic masculinity is a topic that has garnered increased attention in recent years, addressed in various outlets from TV talk shows to social media to myriad print resources. And now, in the latest offering from writer-director Elijah Bynum, the subject has made its way to the big screen (although it almost didn't - see below). This character study of amateur bodybuilder Killian Maddox (Jonathan Majors) follows the life of this highly disciplined competitor who's little known in the field but is determined to one day win major titles and fulfill his dreams of gracing magazine covers devoted to the sport. However, try as he might, Killian never seems to fully realize his aspirations, a tremendous source of personal frustration, particularly when his chiseled physique is (at least in his mind) unduly criticized. He's obsessed with trying to figure out what he's doing wrong, not only in sculpting his physical prowess, but also in his interpersonal dealings. It's an exasperating exercise that often subsequently leads to angry outbursts, exaggerated responses to his circumstances and fits of emotional self-flagellation. To compensate, he earnestly engages in internet searches about ways to get others to like him and to find the means to be remembered, efforts that feed his many personal demons and contribute to an ever-downward spiral of his health, self-esteem and grasp on reality, all of which bring out the toxic masculinity festering within him. His unsettling lack of fulfillment, combined with his considerable pent-up physical strength, makes for quite a volatile mix, raising serious questions about whether he can ultimately contain it. While the film tries to cover a little too much ground at times and features some script elements that come across as wholly implausible, the picture nevertheless offers valuable insights into the nature and source of where this behavior comes from, as well as the hope for redemption, no matter how seemingly remote. The narrative also pays homage to other pictures that chillingly profile the lives of troubled loners like Killian, very much in the same vein as the works of writer-director Paul Schrader, most notably \"Taxi Driver\" (1976) and \"First Reformed\" (2017). To be honest, though, I was quite stunned to see this offering actually make its way into release. Having been originally scheduled for opening during the 2023 awards season, \"Magazine Dreams\" was dropped from its distributor's schedule when troubling allegations about Majors' offscreen abusive behavior began to surface, incidents that would eventually land him in court. In short order, one of Hollywood's fastest-rising stars suddenly became one of the movie industry's biggest pariahs. And, with that, it seemed that this picture - a hot contender for awards consideration at the time - would forever vanish into the ether, relegated to the ranks of films that would never again see the light of day. However, this offering has since managed to secure a new distributor, and it is now playing theatrically (and rather widely at that). It's arguably regrettable that Majors' fortunes have faltered as they have, because he turns in a phenomenal performance here in what would have almost assuredly earned him awards season accolades. This release thus provides a potent cautionary tale about the perils and consequences of toxic masculinity. Indeed, it's understandable how moviegoers might want to shun this release in light of the controversies surrounding its protagonist. At the same time, though, if we as a society ever hope to understand what drives this kind of behavior, we'd be wise to take a good, hard look at it so that we can see how it arises, find ways to dispel it and keep it from inflicting any further harm on those it victimizes - and those who fall prey to it in the first place."},

A team of spies, led by orson (jason statham) goes on an extended mission to stop some deal from going through. Although they don't even know what the deal is for. When they are out and about, they each have their part to play, in ocean's eleven style. Including their friend, the movie star, who everyone fawns over. It's good! Has a fun sense of humor, and some pretty big names. At first, they don't run into any problems, but as it unfolds, there are some surprises to be overcome. Beautiful scenery of turkey! Later on, it kind of turns into a mad scientist wants to rule the world, but it's still pretty light and fun. The running gag is arguing over who drank all the expensive wine."},

Statham does his most basic Statham when he can do much more given the script and direction. Aubrey is ok, i think she was supposed to be funny though and she isnt at all, that isnt her problem because she is generally awesome.

If you would like to be entertained, have a laugh or two and enjoy a break from this world for the length of this movie, then its great!! Hugh Grant is brilliant, almost steals the show. Jason Stratham, well, we always love his movies for the entertainment. The plot is fun, and strangely enough, if there was a couple of sequels to this movie, I most certainly would watch them without glancing at a review - much like John Wick. A refreshing movie, full of fun, action, explosions, gun fire and bad guys being taken out. Whats not to love if you want to be entertained?

It feels like they're just reading Wikipedia or some other listing of career facts. The clips of Carrey are fine overall, since they're mostly from press tours, press conferences, awards shows, and news programs, but probably due to copyright, there aren't many clips from his movies. There are a couple of snippets from In Living Color. Overall, there isn't a real narrative as a document should have."},

She and the 11 others have to stay in total isolation in the titular 'Chapel' for one week as they prepare for their performance in the final.

He shamelessly rips off better cult films and thinks it's homaging, it's not. It merely reminds you there's better made movies out there you could be watching instead. I really wanted to give this one a shot, but it's amateur hour all around with embarrassing performances, including his own, and cheap effects. The rubber masks are painfully obvious. Even viewed as \"schlocky\", it's not even fun. There's better shlock to enjoy than this. I'm not going to allow myself to be tricked by another of Kennedy's movies again. I rented this on Amazon and wanted to warn others against wasting the time or $2 rental fee. Watch a good Lovecraft movie like FROM BEYOND or DAGON which are both streaming for free instead."},

I watched it at the 25th Shanghai International Film Festival and it was a full house on the day. Everyone loved it. We were all absorbed in the story. Jennifer Rogiers who grows up with the emotional traumas about her parents relationships enters into The Queen Elisabeth Competition for the purpose of making her mom proud. Emotionally unstable, she practices like hell and finds herself hard to get along with other contestants staying in the chapel. The piano pieces she plays in the film are powerful especially with the piece by Sergei Rachmaninoff. Actress Taeke Nocolai did a excellent job in portraying the role. She brought us into an emotional ride with her and never lost us. We felt we were next to her following her closely. Very well done. I strongly recommend this film!"},

When faced with such situations, Lucas's reaction in the movie can offer valuable insights. Unlike Jesseca, who confronts the monsters directly, Lucas observes more and tries to identify the weak points of the adversary.

Writer-directors Joe Brewster and Michèle Stephenson earnestly but regrettably struggle to capture the nature and character of this African-American icon of literature and activism, whose 60+-year career has borne witness to the wide-ranging history of the nation's social and cultural movements during that time. Giovanni's take on these subjects has nearly always been radical and unreserved, with criticisms and commentary unapologetically leveled against the initiatives of both the right and the left when she felt the need to express them, frequently making her a lightning rod for attention from opponents on both ends of the spectrum. At the same time, though, she has always made her views known with an eloquently poetic touch, making it difficult for naysayers to find fault with her incisive, spot-on observations. By all rights, this is a life that would seem to provide the makings for an intriguing biography, but, unfortunately, that outcome doesn't materialize as effectively as it might have. The problem rests with the organization of the material included in the film, which at times seems quite scattered, particularly in the unfocused opening half. To its credit, this offering develops a greater sense of lucidity the further one gets into the narrative, but it's too bad that it doesn't live up to this potential throughout. Had it done so, this would have been one of the better documentaries of 2023, but, as it stands now, \"Going to Mars\" leaves audiences with a somewhat frayed portrayal of its subject, at least at the outset. Reading her works, in the end, may ultimately offer viewers a clearer and more complete picture of its principal, someone whose outspoken outlooks truly deserve to be better known at such a critical time in our nation's history."},

The film is a well-done tragi-comedy and I have never seen a Romanian film fit so well in the fine line between artsy festival films and commercial films, made with care and love for the audience. The main character is Vera, a female veterinarian who is strong and also soft, both tough and elegant and loves animals deeply. As a woman myself, I enjoy seeing a powerful female character on screen with all of her strengths and weaknesses, without the need of the writer-director to portray her unidimensionally tough. In the same way, the antagonist, her husband, played by Paul Ipate, is guilty of hurting her but at the same time you see his weak, human nature. The author understands relationships dynamics and the film doesn't judge its characters, but loves and tries to understand them. I wish it last longer and I hope the people will go to cinema and see it. The music is also beautiful and adds to the experience of seeing it."},

Over excited easily pleased toxic fanbase has put this boring mobie to top ratings. The effort should be appreciated but it's not early 90s anymore. World cinema,animation movies have evolved so much but they could have just come up with a better story. They have sold this garbage through a false hype. The jokes are almost decade old and laughter is overdue. IF they make another sequel for this they better come up with better story and charcter development. Overall movie is watchable(barely) but this hype is misleading cashgrab. Sri Lankan people should learn to recognize what's good and what's bad in cinema."},

Expecting it to be another average animation film, I was delighted to find it was not quite so. First of all, the animation is extremely well done which makes the movie enjoyable to watch. The amount of details is astonishing and watching it twice was not a punishment for me. The plot is also surprisingly well thought-of, being funny yet dramatic and it keeps you on your seat while also making you laugh multiple times. It really does feel like everything took years to develop as the environment is complex and believable and the characters resemble their real-life counterparts remarkably well. It's amazing how they could produce a movie with simple jokes suitable for kids yet still silently addressing real-life issues at the same time. At last, I definitely recommend this movie for the whole family as I deem it enjoyable for all ages."},

The film follows the odyssey of a young Syrian girl (Jwan Alqatami), travelling alone, who flees to Turkey from her homeland on her way to Sweden for a reunion with her sisters and parents. But, upon exiting the crowded shipping container that transported her on the first leg of her journey, she's met with a raid by Turkish immigration authorities, barely escaping in the unexpected company of one of the exploitive smugglers who organized her flight to freedom (Ashrof Barhom). Thus begins a trek through Europe as this seemingly mismatched duo makes its way to Sweden, a perilous trip that embroils the protagonists in an engaging array of challenges and revelations, especially the uncovering of the many different sides of these complex characters. As this story plays out, the filmmaker effectively weaves together elements from a variety of genres, including action-adventure tales, thrillers, emotionally touching dramas and road trip/buddy movies, successfully depicting the refugee saga for it truly is - a bittersweet experience filled with joys, triumphs, disappointments and tragedies. It draws much-needed attention to the plight of these downtrodden souls seeking safety from an insane conflict that's needlessly displacing so many innocents caught in the crossfire, just one of many such clashes currently occurring around the world. \"Exodus\" is a genuinely compelling watch, one that truly deserves a mainstream theatrical distribution, as well as recognition for the attention it so absorbingly draws to this urgently heartbreaking crisis."},

She would have been better off helping parents understand how to communicate better with their own children. Your kids belong to you. Judy wants to parent them for you through her books. She saw a hole in the market where parents were falling short in communication and so she provided information and emotional support for them through her books. Her books are about exploring your feelings, bodies, sexuality but lack depth and knowledge on much more important philosophical issues. For instance, how can one make a decision about which religion to choose when given zero information about either one (Are You There God, It's Me, Margaret?). It pained me to watch this over glorification of teen girls exploring their feelings. It did however enlighten me as to why so many people are struggling to thrive these days...it is a lack of parenting. If you don't teach your kids a worldview...how to reason, think and work, they will inevitably fall into just following their desires and feelings. If you don't have difficult conversations on a regular basis, other people will teach things to your kids. Don't let Judy (or any other author) parent for you."},

Never met Judy before but I connected to her through her books. Tiger Eyes being my favorite. The documentary was interesting especially when focused on the backlash her books faced in the Regan era. Also interesting to see was the amount of fan mail she received and that she kept the letters! As usual the \"gatekeepers\" at Prime same as at Netflix, Hulu, etc made sure to insert their plight into the documentary about a 83 year old woman who writes books. A huge turn off for me, but thankfully I was able to fast forward through certain sections. A must watch if you are a Judy Blume fan."},
{"movie_id": "tt18787516", "reviewer_name": "tonyvmonte-54973", "review_date": "Oct 6, 2023", "review_score": "10", "review_text": "As a teen, I read books like \"Are You There God, It's Me, Margaret\" and \"Then Again, Maybe I Won't\" and marveled at how matter-of-fact certain subjects not previously discussed in other fictional books I read were explored. I later read the more mature book \"Forever...\" and thought how author Judy Blume had grown as a writer. I also read another book about her that told how many of those of her novels were banned because of those certain subjects. So I was very interested in this documentary when I discovered it on a recent flight. As her fame grew, Ms. Blume gets interviewed by many of the famous talk show hosts of the time and also appeared in \"Crossfire\" where she debated with conservative figure Pat Buchanan who she didn't even know about previously. But the most touching parts is when she reads letters from many teen girls including a couple of those young women who wrote to her for years to the point that they both agreed to appear in this film talking of how much of an influence she had on them. Had she not decided to write for a living, Ms. Blume would be just another of those housewives just raising her kids and tending to her hubby when he gets home from work but that wasn't what she was comfortable with, that's for sure! She'd eventually leave her first spouse and after failing with her second, she'd eventually find true happiness with a third one who had a daughter who knew of his new wife's work. Ms. Blume herself had two offspring who eventually grew proud of her work. At 83, she seems happy now living in Key West, FL, running a book store where she proudly has on display inside the sign \"We sell banned books\" which I'm guessing includes her own! As a astute observer of adolescent life, Judy Blume Forever is aptly named."},

I don't really see how the latter had an impact on the former. This is just a tool to make a somewhat mercurial subject more digestible for the masses, which is quite reductive honestly speaking. There was barely any exposition to really get at the heart of what made NJP so great. This is the kind of introductory course that spends 2hrs didactically telling us about his brilliance but skirts the chance to deeply explore the origins of that brilliance, and I suppose that is the strength of relying purely on archives. Moreover, the documentary telegraphs everything by following the conventions of chronological narration. Beginning with his early life in war-torn Korea, to his restless irreverent youth, to his maximal, big-scale mid-life period, to his very sad decline. I understand that for an audience who knows nothing about NJP, chronology is an easy form of exposition, however, this barely scratches the surface of his radicalism and complete rejection of art world greed. Unfortunately, decades after his death, his art has been desecrated into some form of commodity, which is the last thing he would have wanted. This is of no fault of the filmmaker, but rather the disgusting nature of art world auction houses and foundations."},

This picture surpasses the \"ghost-story\" genre with its eery gentle approach by leaving the horror and fright out of this picture, but unfortunately it also left out suspense and thrill that would captivate viewer's attention. I appreciated the truthful and realistic political background that was woven into almost every part of the main story. However the themes like loss and grief, that should have been in the foreground according to the director Muayad Alayan, were not as prominent or conspicuous as was promised. Yes, when you look back at \"A House in Jerusalem\", it is obvious that coping with sorrow and misfortune is the primary message of the picture. But on the other hand while watching it you get lost in the narrative a little bit and it almost feels more as a detective story. Overall it was not an unpleasant film, but at the same time watching it didn't evoke any emotions in me and because of that it became quite forgettable."},

It's hard to compare it to anything else on the market because it's so fresh. For viewers looking to step into an entirely new way of filmmaking, this is the perfect film. Exploring metaphysical concepts of our world and beyond, it leaves you thinking about the possibilities of the universe while gently guiding you through a thrilling adventure. The mix of genres holds you in its grasp until the very end leaving you on your toes at every turning point. The colors in the film are stunning with the beautiful backdrop of Sedona as it's canvas. It's a very visually pleasing experience that soothes your mind to contrast the thrill of the chase that drives a certain high energy urgency in the name becoming new. Which all seems very fitting when taking into consideration the high risks that were taken in trying something new with the film altogether. I recommend this film to those who are tired of the same old and desire to challenge their minds with the possibility of a new normal. Can't wait to see more from this director."},

The journey of auditioning actors and their archnemesis in the guise of a casting director, moves you through the day in the life with the added twist of horror (no spoilers!). The story is told with an ode to Hitchcock flare and a fun, popcorn worthy viewers experience. The musical score perfectly reflects the genre, though at times, seems to overshadow the scenes - but we get it! You think you know which characters you're rooting for, but you don't. So, enjoy the plot twists and the shocking, delightful journey, where you come to feel for everyone in it - in this industry."},

She has a rare bone disorder which essentially means that she has bones missing from her legs. Aside from some fairly tortuous surgery when she would have been young, followed by some prosthetics, she was destined to remain smaller but otherwise just as intellectually capable, vibrant and ambitious as anyone else. We follow her determination to have a family (with the sparingly featured Scott) and then her own quest to use the internet to find others with whom she can share experiences, chat and perhaps bond. Glendining is an engaging lady who seems very much from the glass half full school of philosophy. Even when clearly exhausted - mentally and physically, she retains an optimism that together with their young son River seems to help sustain her when the black clouds loom. As ever, though, with one person filmmaking, it's not always the most objective of analysis about much of the rest of the population whom she routinely defines as \"ableist\". Her assertions that society suffers from this flaw is fairly flawed in itself. What is society? It isn't just some sort of concrete jigsaw puzzle into which her tiny piece uncomfortably fits. It's a myriad of different people, personalities, abilities, attitudes - and not many, I suspect, are actually as hostile or indifferent to those less able as she seems to think. \"The world is better with the disabled in it\"? Well who would argue? What is a disability anyway? Broader society is riddled with racism, homophobia, intolerances and we all live in a sort of Venn diagram model style of overlapping circles with each allowing for the differing aspects of human nature regardless as to how or if people may choose to compartmentalise themselves. Clearly this lady hasn't had a straightforward time, but she can come across as just a little inclined to paint everyone else with the same brush. A \"normal\" life is an entirely subjective term and what's great to see here is that she seems focussed on ensuring that her family have exactly that - work notwithstanding - and she presents us with an interesting look at just how she intends to live life to the full. Not perfect, but worth ninety minutes."},

A foreign product is copied without any prior preparation or experience and attempts, or rather attempts, to commercially upgrade it for the market. Favourable location conditions meet more or less naive component juggling in this respect. The result is a good product at first glance, which looks really attractive on the outside in terms of market technology, but on closer inspection quickly reveals content of little value, a work that will not stand the test of time."},

I hated every single second of it , the animation , the plot , the storyline is all so rushed and fast forwarded in an almost nauseating way, to the point where I fell asleep and there was not a single soul in the movies even watching (that's how bad it was) Everytime I dared to look I find myself wanting to throw up and just die."},

Only by defeating the monster can one grow up and become a hero. This film breaks away from such a traditional paradigm. It focuses on a 9-year-old introverted girl, trying to describe her inner world with an extremely gorgeous color. It looks like she fell into a fairytale, surreal world with magic. Colors and darkness just like dreams and reality. Combining with heartwarming music, it unleashes a powerful emotional impact. I believe this film is of great significance for the development of children's mental health."},

The flow of various lights and watercolor hues, creates a strong visual impact. Each frame is like a world-renowned painting that immerse audiences in a beautiful world. The last twenty minutes of the story are tear-jerking, as many details and clues from the earlier part of the story suddenly become clear. Although I haven't experienced the same thing, I've heard from friends who have had similar experiences and can empathize with their tears. This is a story about self-healing and growth, and it's been a long time since a film has touched me so deeply. It may be difficult for young children to understand, so it's recommended that parents watch it with them and guide them through it. I strongly recommend this work to all adults, as it provides a delightful visual experience and provokes empathy and insightful thinking."},

This is seriously the most beautiful, well put together story ever. I can't believe how magical this movie was. The marvelous animation truly made me shed a tear. And especially the ending, that part was just so truly heart touching, words cannot describe the series of emotions I felt. I absolutely loved the climax it had insanely excellent detail. Oh, and we can't forget the conclusion. The conclusion was the greatest and saddest conclusion I have ever seen. Thank you so much Tian Xiao Peng for creating this absolute masterpiece. This is essentially the most important masterpiece of film history. It is a tragedy that this film is so underrated...this transcendent emotional experience will be inaccessible for most. It beautifully encapsulates the human struggle to its basics; suffering, happiness, loss, and despair. It connects with the characters within the viewers, individuals suppressed within our own subconscious. It stays vibrant, fresh, and revolutionizes the art of storytelling and filmmaking while making a damn of statement on what it means to be human. Entertaining, gripping, and simply exhilarating. This might be the most impactful piece of art I've come across in my life, and I'm definitely coming back to it in the near future to study it more deeply. It's an absolute masterpiece of a film. It absolutely moved my soul, and I don't think I can ever be the same. This incredible movie has changed my entire mental state, I am now at peace with who I am and what I will be doing later in my life. I have let go of the past and now I cherish all the little things in life. The animation, music and everything can be heard, tasted, seen, and felt from the screen. You can really tell that the people who worked on this film really poured their heart and soul into producing this. I definitely recommend watching this true piece of modern art. 10/10."},

It is not the usual movie love story. But it is more, because it is real, because it is true, because it is drawn from the living experience of the director. And in one way in the other, all of our lives are movies, only thanks to cinema we have the power to give a different development or ending to those stories. Instead, Song chose, bravely, to be true to what seemingly seems like a \"trivial\" love story of two people who are separated as children and meet again after 20 years by choice and not by chance. Two people who in the generality of their life stories, look at each other, scrutinize each other and love each other. It is a story made of silences, from which the thoughts of the two protagonists arise and arrive. It is a story made of glances and behind those glances are all the unspoken words, all those emotions that words would not render. Past Lives works because it is not what one expects from a film love story. It is real life."},

I know that's vague, but I didn't want to spoil anything, but maybe once you've seen it you'll know what I mean. It was all handled so beautifully and had such heartbreakingly sincere human experiences. I think it's safe to say that in the end, we have no effing idea what we are doing and how it will turn out, but we just hope it's the right decision in the moment."},

Having never experienced a loss of a loved one, this shook me to the core and brought me so close to what a loss would feel like and made me experience grief, even though it's not mine. Aisha was so expressive with her writing and her art that it helps you peak into her heart and soul and forces you to empathise with her. God bless her beautiful soul.

It uses a ton of scripture mixed with historical facts. Professionally made with excellent editing and dynamic narrating. It's not too long or too short but just right. This is a great addition to a short list of documentaries on this subject. Whether or not you agree with the independent fundamental Baptist beliefs, this documentary provides enough historical data to show how the King James Bible has been attacked and the events that transpired before it's inception. The historical facts in of itself are compelling but the Bible says \"faith cometh by hearing and hearing by the word of God\"."},

I especially enjoyed learning about the men who hazarded their lives for people to be able to read a Bible and specifically to have the correct words of God. Brave men like William Tyndale are an encouragement to live by faith and I truly enjoyed how his death was significantly used to provoke other men to deliver us the Bible we have today. Additionally, the information about how the critical text is not superior to the received text was vital to helping people understand why modern Bibles are not faithful translations of the preserved Greek and Hebrew texts."},

This film documents the increasingly Kafkaesque world of abortion access in which the right to abortion access has been increasingly restricted - and nowhere more than here in Texas. Plan C focuses in on the courageous efforts of activists to provide access to abortion pills in states where the medical procedures are now increasingly difficult to attain. This is a case where what is right may not be the same as what is legal. And the laws restricting abortion are inherently classist and racist, because low-income women often lack the means to travel to other states to attain the procedure at a medical facility. This is a courageous film of doctors and activists standing up to unjust citizens through acts of civil disobedience. The film captures their struggle for justice against laws that seem to have come out of the Handmaiden's Tale. Everyone who is concerned about reproductive justice should see this film."},

Along the way, they alight on some rather feisty commune-dwellers who can be quite efficient with a pitch fork whilst all the time being pursued by the folks who want the jewels and by a mysterious apparition, too. Can they catch up with and apprehend their erstwhile pal in time? At times the visual nature of their antics and the humour wouldn't look out of place in a bad Laurel and Hardy movie and though the eye candy carries it for the first half hour, the rest of it is all rather silly and forgettable. There is just too much random activity and too many off-the-wall characterisations to keep it watchable for any longer. If I'm being honest - the word puerile springs to mind."},

When this movie is announced, I have a big expectation because Butak is great. So I hope Duan is better. But, if you already watch a lot of his work that involve Kelantanese traditional play and gangsterisme. Yeah, its the same thing. The idea is good but the execution is still at the level of his television's work. For example, this movie have a lot of fighting scene. I know this production maybe cannot afford Yayan Ruhian, Iko Uwais and Cecep Arif Rahman coreography but we have Areel Abu Bakar who make quite similar international level action in Geran so you can use him for fighting action sequence. The other problem is, too many character, for those who never watch Sabri Yunus's television work, might feel why he include so many people. But I understand because all of them is his regular cast, I think its quite unnecessary because movie is one-shot so you need to focus on the main character and main storyline. However, I still like it but I guess kelantanese will love this movie more. If Kelantan have cinema, this movie will be surely box office there."},

Every now and then there's such a movie, unfortunately Ida isn't one of them. The pace of the movie is too slow and that has a negative effect on the quality. There's some tension building at one point, that worked mostly because of the good soundtrack, but the actual thriller or horror part was just too weak because of the wrong decision-making by the character. There is no reason why a young and healthy woman couldn't push that old lady to the floor and then just outrun her. There are plenty of scenes like that that make the movie just mediocre.

It's essentially all cgi, there are people floating as they walk, gaps in the frame like a really bad photoshop job, I'm pretty sure this was filmed all in one room and the actors were never in that room together as can be seen in the few shots that they 'appear together' as you can see the overlay."},

Directed by Gianluca Leuzzi, the film, while reflecting the duo's established formula, fails to evolve beyond the YouTube children's entertainment brand. The plot is a predictable blend of situations already exploited in previous chapters: Luì and Sofì, fresh from an adventure in Ancient Egypt, find themselves once again having to save the world. This time, a magical source in the jungle is in danger, but the feeling of déjà vu is unavoidable. The film follows the usual pattern: festive atmosphere, hidden danger, race against time, all seasoned with musical moments and comedic numbers. However, \"Missione Giungla\" shows its struggle within the first ten minutes. The plot is thin, and the acting barely decent, often overshadowed by moments of excessive exaggeration. The attempt to embrace the adventure genre is ineffective, with set design and visual effects that seem to come from a YouTube video, but stretched to reach feature-length. The lead duo, Luigi Calagna and Sofia Scalia, with their childish voices, seem trapped in a format that fails to evolve. The predictable plot, TikTok-style dances, and excessive use of plastic effects turn the cinematic experience into a simulation of happiness. While the saga's success can be attributed to children's immunity to déjà vu, \"Missione Giungla\" seems more like an attempt to exploit the brand than a true step forward. The film represents a necessary economic chapter but gets lost in the inability to innovate and offer quality entertainment for new generations. In conclusion, \"Me contro Te - Missione Giungla\" may awaken nostalgia for the nineties, but it fails to take the couple's cinematic experience to new heights. An adventure that, unfortunately, announces the fifth film, maintaining the formula but sacrificing the opportunity for growth."},

Stories were strong ( PTSD felt real) and in some cases heart wrenching; would of liked to know more in the sub plots, there are some unknowns that needed more or not so rushed . Story felt almost docudrama ish, which is why more background on sub plots would have heightened the ending. I appreciate the idea of the homeless shelter, although it felt upscale ish, the idea appealed to me. The actors were believable and well done with they're portrayals. Sophie felt stern yet caring leading the group of past/ current members of her house. Cinematography captured the actors in their vulnerable portrayals and I really enjoyed the outdoor scenes.

In fact the film is sprinkled with such lovely heartfelt moments,and sad onesI have to say it kept me engaged the whole time, wondering what happens next. It was nice to see that there are still people in this world who care for others in.a time of need. It's also brings to light to addiction you need help and also want the help to get better. It's more of a disease than addiction. Definitely a must seen film to watch. To the directors Christina Tsialtas and Maritsa Brikisak on an excellent job on this film, especially being on a low budget film. I was also glad to see that Christina Tsialtas and Maritsa Brikisak did a great job directing the characters ."},

I didn't expect to end up cryin at the end of it the way I did. A part of me cried because I wish I had somebody to help me through my ptsd and my alcoholic trembles amd black outs and difficult times when I thought I am alone. Somebody to talk to when I lost everything. I struggle to this day I am 266 days sober. The film showed harsh realities in a hard world. Ups and downs can happen. One day smiling next day down in the dumps. Sophie needs rules that end up broken and keep them. Harsh realities is so many homeless who don't have a chance. Die in the cold no food no roof to sleep under. Beautiful film loss is real."},

From a mother who has a son in the military go MIA, and refuses to believe he's actually gone, and by holding on to that belief, becomes estranged from her husband and friends. She meets the rest of the characters, all broken in different ways. Some are in physical danger, all are in emotional turmoil. But they all have the good fortune of meeting Sophie. She knows that the \"official\" programs can be insufficient, and sets up a home/shelter to let these people heal. It's an emotional journey for all. In summary, this film will put you in touch with your humanity. I feel enriched after watching it."},

Directors Christina Tsialtas and Maritza Brikisak gave us a powerful look behind this pretty exterior that houses people in various forms of distress.

There are a variety of storylines that each character brings, which ultimately provides viewers with an understanding of many different hardships and circumstances. Despite the very different back stories of the characters, the writers and producers did a great job at intertwining and connecting the characters to create a perfect, seamless storyline. The main takeaway message in my opinion was that there is always a light at the end of tunnel, and you don't need much to help another person.

(despite having other speedrun charity events) Then it goes back talking about another runner then back to gdq. Having this pacing makes the film stuck in repetition like an essay trying to reach the word count, then the guy who narrates the film says he wants no attention yet gives himself the biggest ego stroke at the end which rubs me the wrong way. Overall this film I feels like it doesn't present it's topic well by adding multiple scenes which doesn't make sense or irrelevant at times which results in a complete mess of a documentary. The should have focused on one single topic of speedrunning (History of speedrunning or GDQ) and organized it in a way (chronological and etc.) that it is engaging for the viewers."},

For amateurs production this movie is very well made. I was honsetly very impressed they managed to pull it off so well as they did. Good job.

These elements were played off in such a perfect manner in this movie and the setting alternated smoothly in a way that viewers will be able to understand. An alternate reality concept was also brilliantly used. The actors managed to well portray the emotions of the characters in the movie. Definitely relatable to most people's life. It started off with a love story vibe, moved on with a strong friendship vibe, continuing with another love story vibe but ... ended with a mother's love. I've never seen such a well thought out plot and yet I couldn't find any loopholes in it. All of these were blended into one single movie. A truly amazing Malaysian movie that was worth watching. The movie portrayed a lot of realistic situations & decisions which can make the audience react and relate to."},

Adai Mazhai Kaalam took me on an extraordinary cinematic journey that left me utterly captivated and emotionally shaken. This film has a unique ability to reach deep within your soul and make you question the very essence of what it means to be human. From the opening scene to the closing credits, AMK had me on the edge of my seat, completely immersed in its powerful storytelling. It struck a chord within me that I haven't felt in a long time. The performances in AMK were nothing short of exceptional. The actors breathed life into their characters, making them relatable and genuine. The screenplay was a beautifully written, effortlessly taking us through moments of joy, heartbreak, and introspection. To the entire cast and crew of AMK, thank you for pouring your hearts and souls into this project. Your dedication and talent shine through every frame, creating an unforgettable cinematic experience that will stay with me forever. I wholeheartedly recommend Adai Mazhai Kaalam to everyone!!"},

The acoustics were woefully inadequate and the auditory elements of the film proved to be a constant distraction. Despite the premise of the story being intriguing, the execution of the film was lackluster. The pacing of the narrative was plodding and I found myself becoming disengaged with the plot. Furthermore, the monster was never adequately fleshed out or explored, leaving me feeling unsatisfied and underwhelmed. The film had the potential to be a thought-provoking exploration of a closed community during a pandemic, but instead it fell flat. I also thought at some point, that the movie was a 'troll', due to random and bad acting. The ending proved to be particularly anticlimactic, lacking any sort of resolution or satisfying conclusion, it was a culmination of all the shortcomings of the movie. I would not recommend this film to any discerning cinephile, as it fails to live up to its potential and ultimately proves to be a forgettable."},

Dale Sanders not only dreams, but puts a goal in his sights, one foot in front of the other, one paddle stroke at a time, and makes it it happen. This film is extraordinary. Not only in capturing the essence of this man, but also in portraying the people and events that led up to and supported Dale's efforts to recapture his world record.

We were fortunate to host Dale and his enterauge for lunch at our place on the banks of the Mississippi. We especially enjoyed the selection of music as well as glimpses into his life. It is unfortunate that Stan Stark passed away during this past year and will be unable to challenge Dale's record. We also had the pleasure of meeting Stan following his record trip, and hosting him at our place for lunch. Stan was also an extraordinary man. Ron&Judy URM 1284."},

Well, at least till its third act. The plot is driven by the characters, and its best quality is that it never becomes self-aware. Instead of pleading for our pity, it increases our capacity for empathy. The external environment is always presented as a reflection of the character's inner thoughts. Whether something feels suspicious or appears harmless, it is the perspectives of the characters that we are subscribing to. And this makes the usual ambiance of being inside the house or out in the market very unusual. This treatment of exploring an aged character's psyche makes 'Anur' a slow-footed drama, and intentionally so. The emotions are subdued in the first half as the narrative is mostly built around the insecurities of an old lady living alone, but it does bring in a faint tune of melancholy that surface towards the end. And if you try not to sense the story's pacing but absorb its soul, the right emotions will come for you."},

Its cinematographic strategy is built around a deliberate tension between naturalistic austerity and lyrical interludes, a combination that sets it apart from straightforward combat productions while placing it in dialogue with Attack and Retreat (Italiani brava gente, 1964) and The Opening (Il varco, 2019) - not for narrative similarity, but for their shared commitment to depicting the Eastern Front as an immersive, disorientation-driven environment, rather than a stage for strategic exposition. Like those films, this one observes small groups of men negotiating an indifferent landscape, though it rejects the archival or episodic structures of its predecessors in favour of a more unified, sensorially driven progression."},

The story of a devout Christian man who buys a car possessed by the ghost of it's previous owner - a druggie who blows his brains out with a gun rather than be arrested for drug possession - it effectively uses horror tropes and social stereotypes ( donut loving cops, horny housewives ) to poke fun at modern life. The over the top acting, especially by lead actor Stephen Thomas, suits the movie perfectly. Writer director Maria Galindo does great job of not only telling the story, but of keeping the it moving along in the right horror/comedy tone throughout. The cinematography, art direction, and sound were all exceptional. All in all, a possessed car movie that ranks up there with \"Christine\" and \"The Car.\""},

The plot, thin and amateur as it is, is still somewhat interesting as it centers on the civilian militia in Camden.

The confusing battle footage is followed by a scene in which an actor playing the General Horatio Gates is interrogated.

They style was very intriguing, the VFX at times was a distraction, but I understood the necessity for it.

While there seems to be far too many characters to keep track of who is who, the almost anthology style of story telling maintains a solid through-line of relationships within a black community - wives, husbands, fathers, mothers, sons, and daughters - it's about how each and every one bump up against one another and try to get through their day to day life. The writing is solid in that each scene keeps the audience entertained and does an excellent job of leading to the next, but it still become quite confusing as to whose story you're trying to follow."},

Generic, bland, about as \"basic\" as comedy can get. At not one point does this special ever pick up and grab you. Probably be more effective as background noise while you're doing housework than anything else. I feel like he has reached that level where he has attained some level of success, and now he thinks he doesn't have to try hard anymore. It's very clear in his writing and execution. Unfortunate when comics go this route."},

If you like him on the podcast you will love this special. He is thought provoking, realistic and the vulgar santino we have all come to love. I feel like stand up comedy is an extension into peoples lives behind the camera and how wr all can relate to particular situstions or thoughts we have thst the comedian vocalizes, he nails that dycotomy. He never lets a joke run dry and hits his delivery on every punch line. I highly recommend the special and his podcadts, hes a creative genius and seems like a dude you could defintely drink whiskey and play some pool with."},

He appears to be a charming, decent guy. The issue is that he is just not that funny. It is not that he is offensive, or too esoteric. He covers a variety of topics, from the pandemic to sexuality to growing up in the 80's. His delivery is natural. His jokes and storytelling might be ok if he was a friend of yours, but not enough to conquer a Live audience. One of the other issues with the special is that he is also the Director and it is not shot very well. The special keeps going back and forth between two camera angles and it it a little distracting. I like Netflix comedy and try them all. This was very average, at best."},

Let me start off saying my wife and I are huge comedy fans. We have seen a ton of comedians including some of the greats. Carlin, Pryor, Mooney, also Mencia, Murphy, and Raphi May to name a few. I really didn't know what to expect and being a fan one cold morning I took the plunge. Love him really loved his style, honesty, timing was off the hook and more importantly Mr. Santino was fearless with a wit to match. Political, current, against the grain and soul searching his show had it all in a time when a older generation but very small minority of people want to censor free speech. This guy like Bill Burr is here to stay. Loved it and I highly recommend watching his show."},

There wasnt a single joke that made me laugh. I can't think of one original bit, everything Santino said in this special has already been said in a funnier way by a previous comic. Covid, Prostate exam, global warming etc.... All of it was HACK. If you found this good, I am extremely jealous as you've obviously never seen good comedy and have a lot left to discover. This is on par with Whitney Cummings and Brendan Schaubs latest specials. If I were Santino I would stick to reading ads and doing podcasts."},

About 50% of the way through and I'm honestly not sure what happened to him either before or during the writing process, was he hit in the head by a crazy homeless person? Did he switch bodies with Amy Schumer only while writing jokes? Did someone force him to tell unfunny bits for the first half and save the actual comedy for the second?

What a mess from start to finish. I watched with two of my friends... one of which watches his podcast with Bobby Lee on YouTube. Even He was visibly cringing throughout. This guy just isn't funny. He wants to be. He thinks he is. He's not. It was sad to watch and the only redeeming factor was that we got a good laugh at his expense by roasting how awkward and strange this man is. If you want to watch it, watch it... but don't be surprised if you are left feeling sorry for the guy. Why do so many comedians these days take themselves so seriously??? It's like they think they are the only people on the planet capable of being funny. Off-putting and odd.

Cheeseburger really is a comedy set that is divided into two parts. The first half is hyper focused on politics. It's fatal flaw is Santino can't help but parade his West Coast elite mentality around. As a comedian he should know how badly this alienates half his audience. The second half of the set detours slightly and becomes way too preachy, focusing more on Santino's personal views while being thin on jokes. There is one massive five minute setup for a single joke to land come the end. As someone who occasionally watches highlights of the Bad Friends podcast with Santino and Bobby Lee, I was expecting more out of Santino than this..."},

If this is what comedy has become I am very sad about it.

That's A. W. F. U. L., in EVERY respect. Twilight Zone episodes are FAR better--more gripping, more entertaining, and infinitely more comprehensible! Much of the editing is simply jarring and, ultimately annoying, and does nothing to serve a storyline, or create or enhance a mood. The disembodied, floating head of victor is FAR surpassed by the wizard's head in The Wizard of Oz. The director seems to be trying to leap-frog off of 'Solaris' (1972 (russian Solyaris) and 2002 remake starring george clooney). Indeed, virtually all of the 'effects' are just way better in thousands of other films, sci-fi or otherwise. Towards the end i asked my wife to turn the dam*ed thing off. She replied that there were only 20 minutes left; it has to be one of the most wasted 20 minutes of my entire 70+ years. Maybe if you're heavily stoned or on an acid trip, this film could make you roll with mocking laughter. Really, do not bother with this one."},

Both husband and wife, despite being on opposite ends of the conflict, are likable. The film lacks a sense of amusement; there isn't a traditional climax and resolution. Still, dedicated to portraying a declining relationship authentically, it achieves its objective effectively. The movie poses profound questions and paints a vivid picture of human relationships, occasionally leaving certain plot threads unresolved. This deliberate ambiguity may frustrate some viewers seeking closure, but it serves to encourage further contemplation and interpretation of the film's themes."},

Honestly, I don't blame you for assuming this; half of the people who rated this probably rated it a 10 or 1 because they love or hate KSI. I can assure you that I gave KSI: In Real Life a 10 because this documentary deserves it. Why? Mainly because of the parts in it about KSI's family. Don't get me wrong, the rest of the documentary was hilarious, and fascinatingly made me realize the type of person KSI is; not the good stuff I already knew, but the flaws. However, they can't compare to the parts about his family that hit home. Every time family was mentioned I could feel the water in my eyes trying to break free. I told myself as I watched: \"I ain't crying in no documentary.\" I could not let a documentary be the 5th movie I've cried in out of 300+. But once JJ broke down, I did too. And I'm not talking about a tiny droplet that pushed its way just outside my eye, I'm talking about full on tears that went to my chin. Out of those 5 movies I've cried in, I had never cried as much as I did this time. The only reason this isn't a 10/10 is because most of the movie doesn't have an intense emotion, but the parts that do are sensational. In conclusion, if you are an old or new fan of KSI, watch this through to the end, for if you've never cried in a film, this could be your first."},

Very well made expose on the dark reality of the animal farming industries that covers various aspects without bias. Hats off to the film makers for bringing out the truth.

This film breaks those myths by showcasing the real happenings and discussing with various people who have knowledge and experience on this subject. Indians are generally quite convinced of their 'vegetarianism' but this film shows how being vegetarian which includes consuming animal milk, is wrong and cruel."},

Oh my gosh were my eyes opened!! It makes so much sense to me now, but I just did not connect the dots before. A female cow has to give birth in order to produce milk. Therefore she must be impregnated year after year to keep producing. This is done forcefully by humans only two months after she has given birth time after time after time, and she lives in a state of chronic exploitation through pregnancy, birth and milking, over and over and over again. She is grief stricken every time her baby is taken away from her at birth and it's milk is stolen from her until she is impregnated again and the cycle continues. The male calves are killed, being viewed as useless to humanity. So much more to see in this film that is completely eye-opening! Please, if you do nothing else this year, see this film. 👍🏼"},

Unfortunately, however, that's where this debut feature from writer-director Law Chen (primarily the creator of film shorts and music videos) sorely misses the mark. Based on a true story whose very soundness is somewhat called into question (as demonstrably observed in the picture's opening credits), this \"fictionalized documentary\" about retiree Jerry Liu (portrayed here by his real-life counterpart, amateur actor-writer Jerry Hsu) tells the story of how this hard-working but naïve Chinese immigrant living in Orlando was scammed out of his life savings by conmen posing as police officers from Shanghai investigating a supposed international money laundering scheme. The twist here, though, is how this regrettable incident unexpectedly led Jerry to fulfill his long-held dream of becoming a screenwriter/filmmaker, an aspiration he tinkered with as an amateur in his younger days with his wife and three sons (who appear as themselves in this production). Hsu contends that he wanted to make this movie as a cautionary tale to warn other seniors how to protect themselves against scams like the one he fell for, primarily as a result of holding on too firmly to a belief in being overly trusting of others. It's also something of an homage to the concept of it never being too late in life to start over, particularly when it comes to living out and fulfilling a personal dream. Yet, while both of those intentions are certainly laudable, their execution here leaves much to be desired with its awkward mix of documentarian-style filmmaking and odd attempts at fictionalization (at times verging on the surreal and even hinting at the emerging cognizance issues that Jerry was experiencing at the time of this incident). The result is a picture that doesn't feel fully fleshed out (or thought out), a weird cross between home movies and an experimental arthouse project that ultimately comes across more like a film school assignment. It's also difficult to determine how seriously the film takes itself, with an undercurrent of humor that doesn't always feel appropriate given the troubling circumstances involved in this story. In the end, it's not entirely clear what \"Starring Jerry as Himself\" was attempting to achieve, but the finished product definitely doesn't feel like it attained its goal."},

As an Amsterdammer, I personally feel offended by the way the authorities are portrayed in the movie (police and 'handhaving'). Such use of force simply does not occur in such cases.

Is this somekind of a guerilla marketing campaign with all those 9/10 reviews? The movie is based on an interesting collage of, let's say, a bunch of fuzzy reality ideas. None of them are actually original, I'll skip details to avoid spoilers but suffice to say we know them already from other films. However, if delivered properly this could have been a good experience nonetheless. Unfortunately this did not happen and the only good things I find in this film are the lead actress performance and music. Cinematography could also deserved praising if only they have not decided on reusing just a handful of identical shots almost in a repeating pattern. All actors' performance is bad (except for the lead one) and dialogs are unrealistic. The storyline is very slow, maybe even boring but that's not the problem, there are lots of movies that are probably too slow but overall turn out very good. The bad part here is that for the 3/4 of a movie it keeps the same slow pace and is generally consistent in it, only to suddenly change into some lower-then-B-grade student's action movie in the end. Did the screenwriter's dog ete their only copy of a script book a night before shooting and they had to improvise or something? Seriously, the director and the screewriter should consider career change - I believe it is the same person so that explains why we've got so many issues related to acting, dialogs and plot at once in this film."},

The characters' behavior made absolutely no sense, especially the father of the family that leaves for \"vacation\" in the first act of the film, which sets up the whole hackneyed premise of this monstrosity.

To be honest, like most scary movies. There seems to be some sort of relic or item that is touched by a person or placed on in this case, and the story really unfolds from there. You'll have to keep your attention because the storyline does go back-and-forth at some point, but overall definitely give this film to thumbs up because of the fact that it was rather enjoyable. It's definitely one of those films where you're just kind of hanging out at the house with your partner enjoying the night. It's almost a mood setting movie!"},

I liked everything, from the good casting (one on one like in comics), to the perfect scenery and a beautiful city called St. Petersburg. A very enjoyable film.

The actors were chosen perfectly - I am usually sceptical about child actors but Kay Aleks Getts and Vladimir Yaganov played the young versions of Igor and Ignat so well.

Kieth is a person with great charm and charisma, and had an aura about him of being intellectually superior. He started out like many groups peddling human potential development, instilling in a person a sense of purpose. As it grew, the seminars became more extensive and longer, with the understanding that you must experience discomfort if you want to grow. In reality, it is a technique of breaking a person down to manipulate them. In a way, it is psychological manipulation to have one understand that one can never obtain the goal, but there are workshops ($$$) you can take to try. There are parallels implied to some of the same approaches used by Scientology, which will probably get push back by them. As things became darker, he preached that one being a victim is on you, so it cannot be rape, etc. A person needs to shed their victim hood. The darkest is the recruitment of the DOS program for women. It is chronological, but also a bit uneven. The thing about cults that makes them successful is that one doesn't realize one is in a cult. The strength of the movie is at each stage of the growth of NXIVM, the experts explain how that fits into the eventual goals of the cult. Vanguard and Prefect were names of him and his top associate, so it makes them into not just a person, but much more than that."},

The unproven but often-repeated story about the space shuttle was presented as if it were fact, and the timeline is just plain wrong anyway. The space shuttle exploded during her second ESP class -- but this mockumentary states that she believed she was responsible for the disaster (again: unproven and unverified) and THEN signed up for a second NXIVM (wrong: ESP) class.

It does a good job to stir up different emotions in audience. One of a kind movie, definitely watch. Though direction could have been better. Primary characters are shown to be interacting with each other in different languages pretty easily, despite of the fact that other ones not having any significant knowledge of opposite languages. Audience needs to be pretty ignorant to not notice this. To make this digestable a scene should have been added that characters are trying to learn each other's language."},

It's a bit like My Neighbor the Killer, without the Hollywood scale and far more endearing, since his new \"handicap\" forces him to team up with his neighbors, a sweet, almost ordinary couple."},

The plot was giving some resemblance with Dileep's 'Spanish Masala'.

Taking us through an intimate journey, the movie hints at how much character and grit and fierceness Nilambur Ayisha has through flashbacks from her past as well as her life as a maid at the palace.

They could certainly pass for that, anyway. All the business of both groups is done in English, and it is clear that most of the principals don't speak Muscogee.

Because of this, I actually feel that the real focus is the intellectual battle between the organization and Conan. While there are many cases involving the Special Express, the brain-burning plotline of trying to eliminate Vermouth involves numerous characters and Conan's clever schemes.

{"movie_id": "tt8649352", "reviewer_name": "CinemaSerf", "review_date": "Oct 19, 2023", "review_score": "6", "review_text": "Though the narrative is a little too undercooked here, this film does present us with two characterful performances from Déborah Lukumuena and Le'Shantey Bonsu. The former is \"Grace\" - a woman who lives in a rundown Glasgow high-rise with her daughter \"Ama\". Their's is a loving relationship tinged with a little maternal paranoia. \"Grace\" is forced to work as a cleaner at night and the girl is largely forbidden from leaving the flat - for her own safety - and that, naturally, attracts the attention of the social workers and the school teachers who are concerned for their wellbeing. Things are not helped by a decision to rehouse the family as the demolition men are soon to head to their tower block. When \"Ama\" befriends a neighbour from her school \"Fiona\" (a nice effort from Liana Turner), the couple's relationship starts to become severely tested and the two women face the first serious change to the established dynamic of their inter-dependency. The performances do go some way to making this film work, but the absence of context makes it difficult to engage with the story. We don't really know anything about the past that drove them to Scotland. Clearly there has been trauma for \"Grace\", but again - we know very little about what created that trouble. The direction is also very lethargic. Far too many tracking shots, walking to and fro, almost like director Adura Onashile was paddling out a short story into almost ninety minutes. I also found it to be rather over-scored. The paucity of dialogue does work at times, but the sense of loneliness and fear that generates is all to frequently overpowered by the music. It's an interesting story that is probably illustrative of many families relocated to a strange environment, but I just needed more substance and less meandering images for that to resonate better."},

Their chemistry in the movie was exceptional. Le'Shantey is a naturalist.. the way she brought the character Ama to life was splendid.. watching Girl.. you can feel the emotion she displayed. For Girl to be Le'Shanteys first movie, i believe she deserves an award for the best upcoming young british actress. Deborah is an phenomenal french actress. I understand why the casting director and the director & writer Adura knew that she was best the character to play Grace."},

Epic and compelling storyline that went across three generations of a bloodline afflicted by a terrifying and mysterious entity. Great use of creepy effects. Really great casting for the film and most of the performances were above par of what you'd see in many indie films. I liked that that actors were cast not for their pretty faces, but most were more appropriately cast for characters who had lived rough lives with lots of hardship. Really enjoyed the scenes and dialogue of the creepy neighbor - especially his final bit of dialogue."},

Most of the actors did a fine job but I don't like judging actors since I'm not one and don't know what they have to go through to do what they do. The editing was great and the music really worked to set the mood. I think any fan of horror and independent films should watch this one. I don't feel anyone would be disappointed with it.

It's got supernatural elements, hypnotism elements. It's got a little back-and-forth Pulp-Fiction/Quentin-Tarantino-style. It's definitely an arthouse film. The best way to describe it is like a David Lynch film on bath salts. It's crazy. Reminded me a bit of Mulholland Dr. I really liked what they did with the camera work and the attention to detail that they had with this project. The acting is really good, the mood is exactly what it needs to be, and the pacing is just right. You won't get bored, that's for sure. This was extremely well done.

It has a crazy hypnotherapist who is helping Kimberly, a troubled and haunted woman, overcome her past traumas. If you want to watch something different, ominous, dark and demonic; then this is the film for you! The characters are terrifying, well thought out, and they play their roles well. We find ourselves invested in the main character Kimberly. She has a daughter Erica, who was conceived after a brutal attack. Said girl is adopted by a family, Shawn and Tiffany. James, who plays an important role in the film, is the lead detective, after Harold the crazy hypnotists is murdered. There are a bunch of twists and turns as this movie progresses. The plot turns really enhance the film. I like the use of colour that helps to set the scene and push the narrative and storyline along, in a really interesting way. There are flashback scenes, visions, people lost in their trance like states. The colour red is a motif throughout the film. It also indicates when someone is in a trance. The sound effects and soundtrack music is top notch, and some of it was composed by Chris Shern, who is also one of the writers and main actors in the film, where he plays Harold. I really enjoyed the music as it overlaps the scenes in a very interesting way. They helped to enhance the scenes. The cinematography is great, as there are very intimate close-up shots, that explore emotion on their faces. There are some great horror scenes. The surrealism of this film is intense and captivating. There is a good amount of tension and suspense splattered throughout the film to keep you guessing what is going to happen. The blood moon is an interesting plot, as we see how this comes to mean something intriguing to the film, adding depth and layering to the storyline and the overall plot. The ending is maddening and not at all what I expected to happen! I really enjoy a good film with a few twists. Leaving us to ponder the outcome and it really shows the deplorable human condition at its very worse."},

As this is shot in a extravagant arthouse style featuring interesting color, bizarre imagery, which leads to it becoming far more immersive and engaging as the storyline unfolds.

I usually avoid arthouse films because they're not necessarily my forte but this film is so much more than that, it feels equal parts artsy and horrific simultaneously. There's imagery in this film that will stay with you long after the credits roll. In fact, there were quite a few instances where I was like, \"Did that really just happen?!\" If you're looking for a film that blends the line between reality and imagination THIS IS IT!

Ballard. With those memories I watched this documentary about the Ballard years in Maple Leaf history. It begins by noting the Leaf dynasty of the 1960's (4 Stanley Cups), runs through how Ballard ended up in control and then traces the decline and fa!! Of the team and deals a lot with the clown show the team became. It's full of historic footage of Ballard, and features lots of interviews with players and executives and reporters who dealt with him.

Ballard's goal throughout has been to enhance his personal wealth and he was so fortunate that hockey fans in Toronto kept buying those hard-to-get tickets throughout. As long as revenue remained high, Ballard saw no reason to \"waste\" it on quality players or coaches or scouts for future players. The fans became enablers of his greedy lifestyle. Priestly has done a fine job of interviewing all the relevant characters from the late 60's thru 1993. Current Leaf fans will find this educational, especially those under age 35."},

The acting is forced and amateurish, particularly the performance by the writer/director. I've seen better acting at high school stage productions.

The direction and cinematography is also very amateurish - eye lines rarely match up when cutting from shot to shot. The music often feels completely out of place, too.

The romantic story evolves slowly yet steadily with its pleasant gentle soundtrack and a fantastical undertone. I actually didn't mind that the whole plot was far-fetched and obviously impossible and not realistic, because from the beginning Chris Raiber, the director and screenwriter, didn't even try to convince us that this story should be taking place in the real world. I only wish we got to see some scenes that were more honest or straightforward in dialogue, because the characters mostly speak in metaphores or in a poetic manner - I would have loved to see some rawer or more naturalistic parts of the script for it would add some contrast to the whole narrative that otherwise feels a bit too uniform. But despite this I still think it is a nice spin on the romantic genre."},

The second film has the mirror title (Living Bad) and was also shown at the same edition of the festival in the parallel Encounters section. Joao Canijo's direction, scriptwriting, and conceptualization of the diptych makes one sit up. Both films have the same actors, with their screen-time inverted. \"Bad Living\" details an all women cast, of a family spread over three live generations, owning a hotel and their complex relationships. \"Living Bad\" is about the mirror world of a group of guests arriving at the hotel, with the same hotel owners dealing with their problems in the periphery. More interestingly, \"Bad Living\" is loosely based on the director's childhood (ref. IMDB trivia). \"Living Bad\" relates to the guests' interactions with the hotel owners and their traumas. Most interestingly, director Canijo structures the films on the lines of the works of writer-theosophist August Strindberg--whose works were influenced by his own life that switched from anti-Semitism to free thinking to atheism and, finally, back to religion. While I write this, I have yet to view the second part of the diptych. I will take keen interest henceforth in director/screenplaywriter Canijo's works. Finally, the ensemble cast of \"Bad Living\" impressed me."},

While most films are pure entertainment (and there is no problem with that), films like this are necessary, not only to get out of the ordinary, but also to help us better understand people and their attitudes.

Canijo's work invites us to reflect on the weight of family ties and the role of physical space in the formation of memories and conflicts. With careful direction and an almost documentary approach, João Canijo transforms a seaside hotel into a stage for the tragedy and beauty of human coexistence. It is an invitation to the viewer to look inside themselves, through the eyes of a family that, despite its flaws, seeks to survive together, even when the past and wounds insist on manifesting themselves."},

This is the one I liked best. I guess I resonate much more with the Chinese-ness of the characters. They are more relatable in a way, they make much more sense to me. I also liked the locales, the old houses and streets. It is a bloated movie, there are scenes that could've been cut, maybe a good half hour of it. But this resonated with me, I found myself interested and drawn to some of the characters and their stories. I liked Ouyang Wenhui the least probably, unlike Park So-dam's character in Ode to the Goose. But the rest of them I wanted to know more about. Even Gu's poor renter has a pretty good scene. His sister, daughter, brother-in-law, his ex, his old school friends, his dad, his mom. I wanted more time with them instead of semi-dreamscape passages but it's ok. I'm glad I had the patience for it."},

Of course I'm left with some huge cliffhangers which will make the gods 3 awesome! Can't wait to see what they come up with next.

The father and son bond in the film was awesome I can't wait for the next film in this Saga.

Mykel Shannon Jenkins gives a nuanced and seasoned performance as a man trapped in a world that's destroying everything he loves. Embodying a character broken by PTSD and flashbacks from his heartbreaking past, Jenkins weaves a web of raw emotions that is seldom seen in this genre, and it's what takes this film to another level. It's hard to believe this film wasn't produced by a major studio with a huge budget. For Jenkins to have written, produced, directed and starred in this film is nothing short of miraculous. Other outstanding performances by Kevin Interdonato and Antony Sauvé make this film a joy to watch for anyone who loves the art of acting."},

As a sequel, \"Jalan Yang Jauh\" is certainly able to match the level of its predecessor (Nanti Kita Cerita Tentang Hari Ini) - with a narrower scope of conflict, this film even has a better ending. Of course what can't be forgotten is how Sheila Dara once again proved her acting skills as a struggling young middle class woman (also Lutesha as my favorite scene stealer).

The movie is structured around reading the letters (reminding me of Chantal Akerman's movie, Letters from home) wrote to each other between 2 women, one Romanian, the other Iranian, read on the background of social political events in both countries, mirroring each other's stolen dreams and revolutions.

She starts out aloof and temperamental before turning into someone more mindful and responsible. This movie, the first project where she's the lead, shows how far she's come. Having it focus on her babysitting service is a pretty smart choice, as it allows her to show off how well she can adapt to any situation. She shows a great deal of leadership qualities, such as looking out for others and helping those that can't help themselves. Everything else about the movie works pretty well, such as how enjoyable the new characters are, Tammy gaining more depth, and the music being enjoyable. I definitely recommend checking this out."},

With the world of Barbie: Dreamhouse Adventures, she became a more nuanced and three dimensional character. Over the years, she becomes someone who's more mindful of others and more willing to do the right thing. This movie shows how well she's developed. The best way to describe this movie is with how we get to see more sides to her characters. She's fun and snarky, but also more willing to look out for others. She takes the initiative to make the most of herself and do what she can to help people find their voice. It's really fun to see her blossom and grow into someone who can make people feel safe and secure. She makes mistakes sure, but focuses more on doing the right thing.

Another thing that I would compliment is its beutiful cinematography that perfectly captures sunlight glittering on the water surface, soft tree shades in nearby forests and overall summer atmosphere. On the other hand I wish the story let us more into the characters minds and feelings, beacuse in my opinion all of them were kind of one-sided, superficial and blurry. The main theme that connected the three protagonists - loss of their mothers - was pleasing, but it got a bit lost in the narrative (untill the very end, when we were reminded of it again). Overall I don't think it was a bad film, just not exceptional enough."},

The acting is good and the premise is also interesting. The whole movie feels like a student project. It is unbearable slow,which should allow for some good character development. But nothing. Soo many flashbacks, unlikable characters and some strange creative choices. But the absolute worst is the ending. Such an anti climax, pointless and not even slightly satisfying. I created this account just for the review. What a waste of time. Who expects ab action movie , this isn't it. For people that like character studies or drama, it will not be rewarding."},

A man accused of murdering his daughter set free after 20 years coming back to his hometown to find answers and revenge. But the move gets a low pace very quickly. As soon as all the characters have been thoroughly introduced I was expecting some action. But it nothing happens. Until the very latest of the movie, when he finally wants to use violence, it's ended with an anticlimax. Although the acting is okay, it's just the story that fel short. Especially after watching a Scott Adkins action movie this one is very disappointing. Not sure why some rated it so high. For me it was utter waste of time."},

Part of their marketing is that this is the first AmazonPrime-produced filipino movie and i'd say it really did not disappoint. I would not say this is original since It's taking pages off Agatha Christie's novels - i observed touches of 'Ten Little Indians' (And Then There Were None), 'ABC Murder'. 'Black Coffee' and 'Murder on the Orient Express'. But since Christie's novels aren't really big here in Asia it would pass to be something new for Filipinos. Execution and script is great - It embodied local culture discussing the reality in a life of a mistress, female empowerment and self-respect. Concept is well executed and the satirical aspects were timely. Cinematography is great and I think the production team did a great job selecting the actor/actresses. Kudos to all the 'mistresses' as they were all brilliant in their own way. I just think it would have been better if each of the mistresses' backstory (or murder motive) were highlighted -as that would have added to the mystery theme. It would have been generic had it not been for the comedic antics and sequences. It was a fun movie overall and definitely above average.

You can predict what will happen as far as the mystery death almost midway in the film and when that occurs its more a down slide after that. The acting with Marques Houston, Serayah and Blue Kimble are OK and they did what they could with a lackluster script that doesn't give its lead actors much to work with, but the film overall is average fare."},

I stuck with it although getting halfway through it was a waste of time. By the time I realized I had wasted the time watching, I could have been doing something, or anything more productive. I would not recommend this film to anyone. Watch anything but this. Condolences to the writer."},

Real life aligns with the wisdom shared in the film: entrepreneurship isn't just about making money; it's about fulfilling needs. Needs are the mother of invention, and the process of creating ways to meet those needs is what entrepreneurship is all about. Instead of doing it alone, it's often better to convince a group of shareholders to do it together. If the product isn't selling, then you have to figure out ways to make people want it. It's really heartwarming to see a child explain that entrepreneurship and breaking out of economic difficulties involve taking one step at a time and adapting methods to meet legal and customer requirements. It's so good that it's worth watching multiple times."},

The filmmakers made great usage of all the archived footage and interviews they had at their disposal. Hearing about Donna Summer's life story and home life was very surprising and introduced so many more layers that I never knew about before. In my opinion, if a documentary does it's job right, it will make you want to look up more information about the artist afterwards. My favorite music documentaries (Searching For Sugarman, A Band Called Death, Zappa, Sinatra: All Or Nothing At All) make you want to look up more about the subject after the film is done. This documentary makes me want to do exactly that, and I love it! If you have a chance to watch this film, do so."},

Her songs have never really left my playlists, and a few still get me through weekday workouts. This documentary, however, might have benefited from a steadier hand than that of her daughter, who keeps the focus a bit too personal and not quite wide enough to capture Donna's full cultural impact. Only after watching did I realize, thanks to a post-viewing deep dive, just how revolutionary Giorgio Moroder's production on \"I Feel Love\" was. Still, it's a warm, affectionate portrait of a singular talent and a reminder of how extraordinary her run of late-1970s hits were. The film may not dazzle, but the music still does, and that's more than enough reason to press play and enjoy a bit of nostalgia."},

No surprise since her daughter Brooklyn Sudano co-directed this film with Roger Ross Williams, and the result is rich with archival footage and home movies. The daughter's perspective is valuable but not really that objective. What the film lacks at its core is a deeper understanding of the professional choices Summer made to shape and redefine her varied career from disco sex goddess to impressively versatile performer. That was the level of insight I was hoping for in this documentary."},

But mainly I found it very, very, very boring although I was a great fan of hers. Someone born over 50 years ago, in 1970, would be 52 to 53 years old today. Yet there is no context provided for Donna Summer's career, almost nothing about the era, very little about disco music. The film just assumes that the viewer is very familiar with all this and very familiar with Donna Summer. And they could not show a single performance of one entire song? Or play one entire record all the way through? There's a lot of \"home video\" type film which is just a bunch of people messing around and does nothing to illustrate anything about Donna Summer. Her fall from popularity was almost as dramatic as her rise, yet as another reviewer said you'd think from this film that she went right from a major career to lung cancer and dying. What happened in between? A sadly missed opportunity; a fascinating performer turned into a boring subject and a documentary which provides little relevance for anyone not over 50."},

Her voice had a resonance that kept you listening. I found this documentary stretched to find a story outside her career that just didn't really do anything to make her legacy shine brighter but rather more of her daughter's search to understand her mother who clearly was exceptionally reserved and not fully connected to her children. Even her love affairs seemed shallow. I found this documentary more discrediting than inspiring. A lot of scenes were flat, lots of unnecessary home video that made me want to turn it off and just stream one of her live performances to remember the bottom line - great voice."},

The documentary follows Donna Summer's career from Germany to the US, revealing her life behind closed doors. The opening scene features Donna singing the song, while the film cuts to an extreme-close-up of her doe eyes. The film explores Summer's indefinability, dichotomies, and suggests there's more to learn. \"Love to Love You, Donna Summer\" explores the highs and lows of Summer's career, as well as her struggles as a woman, mother, and new star. The film's heart lies in its narrative and structural relationships, with frequent narration from Summer's daughters and a focus on her childhood with a distant mother. The desire to understand Summer beyond her parenthood and into her personhood is the movie's foundation. Summer's Black womanhood is significant, as she navigates her adolescent years in Boston with her religious family to her eventual success as a sensual American disco star. She embodies passion and perseverance, breaking societal expectations and championing her identity as the power it was, despite being seen as a novelty. Summer's journey showcases her bold determination and passion for embracing her identity. \"Love to Love You, Donna Summer\" is a candid portrayal of Donna Summer, a pioneer and icon who constantly fought against herself. The documentary offers a glimpse into her music, but lacks a deeper understanding of her creations. While it provides insight into Summer's music, it may alienate those unfamiliar with her music. Fans of Summer will appreciate the film's depth and appreciation, while others may overlook the documentary's lack of breadth. Overall, \"Love to Love You, Donna Summer\" is a valuable documentary that showcases the impact of Donna Summer on music and her legacy. Summer's Black womanhood is evident in her life, from adolescent beginnings in Boston with her religious family to her eventual blossoming as a beacon of sensuality in the American disco scene. She embraced sex and championed her identity, despite being seen as a novelty. Her iconic songs, like \"Love to Love You, Donna Summer,\" showcase her career benchmarks and ability to maintain relevance in changing times. Her hit \"Love to Love You\" emphasized her openness and leaning into sexual culture of the '70s, while \"She Works Hard for the Money\" pointed at her own label, which she sued for absent payments. Despite these peaks, Summer faced both upliftment and downfall, with the constant attention and influences of the industry burying her on a pedestal, creating a plaguing dichotomy."},

He's not much more than a courier now and that's a mighty steep fall. When his partner, Bobby (Mister Fitzgerald), comes to him with the possibility for one big last deal that could save the business and even get him ahead it's too good to resist. Unable to completely handle the score himself, he turns to the Boss (Sala Baker) seeking a buy-in. Everything has to go right. Of course, it doesn't. The Last Deal is that rare convincing low-budget action flick that soars on the strength of a talented production crew and incredibly strong ensemble led by stunt man/actor Molinari. With almost a couple hundred stunt credits, there's literally no doubt you've seen Molinari's work but The Last Deal makes it perfectly clear that he's leading man material. Salemi's script is substantial, both convincing as an action flick and as a cultural statement. If you don't get the film's messages, you're likely not paying close enough attention."},

The film follows an interesting approach: it sheds light on the drug and especially the marijuana milieu in California after the legalisation of cannabis. The central theme is how an illegal scene has to adapt as a result of the sudden legalisation and has to face new problems despite the supposedly improved situation."},

One must have a real gut to make this movie. The director has done a fabulous movie. No words are enough for music and performances. The background score has really lifted the entire movie. Performances by the male lead Sarthak and female lead Kahima are wonderful to watch. The highlight of the movie is the climax. It really gives goosebumps for sure. I would say this movie should be an example for stars who think they are invincible. Also to fans who become enamored by stars so much that they have life in reality. Such ample incidences in this movie not only keep audiences hooked but also give good message to people. This movie is a must watch."},

I watched this because the Rotten Tomatoes reviews were mostly positive, and the one bad one said \"it got ridiculous halfway through\" which sounded just fine to me. Unfortunately they were pretty much correct. The film dances back and forth between a realistic situation and an over-the-top fantasy before finally being violently hurled towards the latter. Some of the weakest moments are that much of the plot involves the movie's version of Twitter, so there are long periods of reading tweets while the main character looks at a screen. The ending has me very conflicted, because while it was handled poorly it had a couple of good points to it. Overall it was a fun watch, but not anything I'll tell anyone they NEED to see."},

Nothing here has changed for centuries as the younger generations tend the sheep flocks and the elderly whilst nature presents them with some challenges that test not just their faith in themselves but their desires to stay and live this subsistence life. Some don't, and move to the big city where electricity, running water, food and jobs are far more plentiful. There is a scene with an elderly lady walking up a steep hill carrying two buckets of water on a pole across her shoulders that did make me hope that she didn't have to retake that shot too often, and indeed there are plenty of authentic images as these villagers grapple with everything from the ageing process to drought. For the most part, we take our view from the youngsters of this community and that offers us something freshly optimistic and tangibly realistic - and the filming provides us with an observation, amidst some beautiful and pristine scenery, of a lifestyle that probably faces it's most formidable of obstacles despite their enthusiasm and stoicism. It's a film about humanity and nature existing with a certain degree of synchronicity and is crafted accordingly."},

The young actress who plays both sisters does an outstanding job of giving each her own personality. (This would naturally not have been possible without the stand-in who plays the other sister in scenes where split screen was not an option.) The story unfolds in a mostly urban environment in the year 1999. The fallout of the Thai economic crash of the late 1990s and the hullabaloo about the turn of the millennium, as well as the fear of the Y2K problem sparking the end of the world play in the background. The story does not need any beach settings or tourist attractions to hold the viewer's attention. It is the interaction between the sisters, complicated by their first crush and financial strain on their family life, that carries the story forward. I liked it."},

The film is about three look-alike, who meet up through a website and what happens after making up the story. The writing was dull and inconsistent. It does not create any interest in the storyline. The concept of the plot line was good but the writing has ruined the potential. The script could have been more crisp and apt, removing unnecessary scenes. The screenplay was mushy and had irrelevant scenes in the movie. The screenplay could have created a thrill to the already ruined script but is also a huge letdown. The performances were below average, except for Kalyan Ram's triple role appearance, which was made with the most effort. The direction was mismatched and heading in a commercial direction but was flawed. The direction was leading in underwhelming and didn't help the scope of the script at all. The cinematography was poor but did stand in some scenes. The editing was done on average. The music was totally wasted and had no impact on the story. Overall, Amigos is an underwhelming story that had wasted a story with potential."},

Wife \"Maryam\" (Marall Nasiri) is expecting a baby which is quite a surprise given the two aren't exactly loved-up! Their initial application has been rejected so they must appeal. He comes across as a decent, hard working man and before he took a job delivering pizzas in all weathers, he was a part of the Iranian wrestling team at the Rio Olympiad. He reckons that if he joins a local team, it might earn them some extra brownie points with the immigration authorities. She's less than impressed with this decision, and as he plays more of a part with the team and befriends \"Thomas\" (Björn Elgerd) we begin to piece together a jigsaw that explains a bit of their hasty flight from home, their strained marriage and the current conflict that neither he nor she can see an easy way out of. On some levels, this works quite well - but there are just too many plot holes and the story evolves in all too bitty a fashion. It doesn't address the elephant in the room directly, but leaves us to make our own assumptions before it ends unsatisfactorily and incompletely. It has a point to make, it just doesn't really make it very forcefully or memorably. It does make you realise just how physical wrestling is, though, but otherwise rather disappoints."},

We are then transported to 1914, where we meet Adele and Jean, married, very much in love, and they really want a baby, although with no success. He is called to war, and promises it will happen after the war. It is now 1918, and Jean has been killed in the trenches. The book resurfaces, and it is black magic, and using moss and some of her own blood, she fashions a figurine of her husband and plants it. We then see what seems like a gourd growing from where she planted the figurine, and it is like a cocoon, which she severs from the vine, and brings it back home. It is her husband, or is it?

Scattered images and audio portend things dark and unnatural in the approximate first third. Furthermore, alongside elements like atmospheric lighting, artful and deliberate cinematography, flavorful and pensive music, and careful art direction, those images and audio invoke a spirit of dark fantasy that rather brings to mind fare like Guillermo del Toro's 'Pan's labyrinth,' or maybe Louis Malle's 'Black moon.' 'The thing behind the door' makes headway only in its own time, and opts for darkness and sinister fun that are distinctly subtler compared to most other genre flicks; gently emphasizing the point, there is far less dialogue here than in other titles, and at that it's decidedly deemphasized or even unimportant. It's an approach that will certainly not appeal to all, and those who prefer abject visceral thrills or instant gratification may be put out. Yet for my part, I rather love it: a slice of horror that is rendered with utmost delicacy and shrewd finesse."},

Uniquely, and surprisingly I came to recognize while watching this movie that this story is a captured and hidden gem. I've watch hundreds, yep, hundreds of rom com, hallmark, lifetime whatever movies you want to call them that fall into the familiar genre of drama and romance. And uniquely, although this very movie wasn't hugely emotionally moving, I thought this movie was truthfully revealing. My favorite aspect of the truth of it all was that the script was soft on the ears and key on the relationship tips. One tip, and maybe a good learning, is that there might just be no Mr. Right, but what I believe even more, are many Mr. Almost Rights & and many Ms. Almost Rights. In a world where we are filled in our minds to look for the right \"Only One\" or the \"Mr. Right\" it all seems to be what gets all twisted in our heads, whether a man or a woman pursuing in life to find the right person for them. What I'm saying is it's 2am, and I'm sitting on my couch, I'm in myself the Film industry an actress also and a regular everyday gal looking for a special guy. And you know, this movie is what it's all about, it's Mr. Almost Right & Ms. Almost Right, because honesty I think there is no Mr. Or Ms. Right, there's just a good gal and good guy who one day will be \"Mr. Almost Right\" andAlmost Ms. Right\" and I hope I find him too.

Two individuals who fall in love must fall into some danger and take some twists and turns. The writing was interesting with a fresh and new concept. The writing of the film becomes more interesting with the idea implemented. Although the narrative is flat and watered down for most of the scenes, the writing lifts the soul of the film and takes the audience on a thrilling ride. The screenplay was designed nicely and gives the audience good twists throughout the film. The second half of the film is more interesting because of the twists which seem to be very impressive than expected. The screenplay is probably one of the best highlights of the film. The direction was decent and it impresses for the most part but might be a letdown in some scenes as the narrative is flat. The cinematography was decent but the costume design was impressive in a few scenes. The music was a big let down and it does not suit any of the scenes. The production value was pretty good and looked on screen. Overall, the movie is decent for the storyline and screenplay."},

Until last 40 minutes the movie kind of feels all over the place, but it comes together towards the end. I was disappointed with the setting, the Tirupathi backdrop was so artificial and was not showcased well. They tried to make the setting significant but failed and chose stereotypical Tirupati locations and actions. The whole helping people thing was dealt with in a cringe fashion and was cringey most times it appeared but I liked that they used it as a plot point.

It's a serious psychological film. People who have an interest in Ingeborg Bachmann and Max Frisch of course have an advantage watching this. It's some kind of relationship study. Obviously the relationship is between two special persons (giants of literature), and the interaction between the relationship and the artistic production of the characters is an issue here. There is much food for thought, also regarding the changing roles of men and women, what people expect from love and relationships, how they deal with separation, and so on. Ronald Zehrfeld as Max Frisch is very convincing. I have more problems with Vicky Krieps as Ingeborg Bachmann. Her looks and gestures are fine (actually visual similarity to the real Bachmann and Frisch may have played a role casting these actors, though Krieps is maybe a bit too beautiful even when emotionally shattered), but I can't get rid of the impression \"21st century actress\" rather than \"20th century poet\" when she talks. Also in most (though not all) scenes after the separation, Krieps comes over as more positive and ebullient than I'd think Bachmann was at that time, according to what I know from Wikipedia and other sources. What is shown of the relationship between Bachmann and Frisch doesn't really make clear to me what tied them to each other apart from the initial attraction (but this happens often in films; it may be my personal issue actually); particularly of Frisch we see little that makes him a sympathetic character. But then maybe he just was like this. I regularly have the problem with fictional films about real events that it isn't clear, regarding many details, to what extent these are \"true\" to reality at least in some sense, and how legitimate it is to deviate. Anything that doesn't seem realistic can be justified by a sensible connection to the real events/characters, but as spectator I don't always know enough to assess this."},

Similar to the old 1960's TV show \"Time Tunnel\" with it's almost identical time portal setup, this movie tells of a man who is the victim of an accident in time and his path to fix it before the world ends because of it. It is very low budget, and literally most of the action is in a lab or out near a pile of rocks. Not bad for what you get as far as story and rather good acting. Those who put this down or who were \"bored\" didn't give it a real chance. It is quite good and if you have a peaceful night to enjoy an engaging film, this does a good job. It does keep you interested if you have the brains to figure out what's going on. Nothing questionable, no nudity, no foul language so its good for everyone that can handle a bit of a mind game.

They deride it as bland to the chagrin of her feisty grandmother who promises that they'll be back. It's on their lengthy drive afterwards that we discover something of the close bond between them and that she's got quite a nasty cough. Back home, her mother \"Scarlett\" is concerned at events that end up with the old lady in hospital with, according to the nervous \"Dr. Patel\", not too long to go. It's around this time that the youngster meets \"Anastasia\" in the woods. She is a sympathetic and slightly enigmatic soul who assures the girl that everything will be \"grand\" - but who is she? She knows things she shouldn't but not in a malevolent fashion. When she eventually meets granny, things begin to make a little sense as the four women travel/abscond to her abandoned childhood home in County Wexford. It does meander a little too much: there are far too many animated equivalents of establishing and beauty shots, and there isn't a great deal of jeopardy as the plot unravels rather predictably. That doesn't matter so much, though, as this adaptation of Roddy Doyle's story of family, love, life and ... death manages to hit home in a subtle and friendly fashion. The art work itself is a little two dimensional, with most of the visual emphasis on the big-eyed faces but try to stay focussed on the colcannon that you can almost smell.

{"movie_id": "tt8096846", "reviewer_name": "blhubner", "review_date": "Nov 28, 2025", "review_score": "8", "review_text": "This film is a Hungarian-Slovak animated feature about a dystopian future society that, on a devastated Earth, has developed a system to continue human life in a modified form. The city is protected by a giant dome, and its inhabitants are granted the right to live for fifty years. After that, society takes possession of their bodies and - without spoiling too much of the twist - the essence of the film revolves around a symbiosis between plant and human. Technically, it's a striking film. The animation, in which real, live-action actors are artistically transformed, is highly creative and at times delivers breathtaking and deeply emotional imagery. However, the quality isn't consistent: at its weaker moments, the film resembles a computer game, while at its best it reaches genuine heights. The story has a slightly hallucinatory quality, and the unbalanced nature of the narrative is actually the film's weakest aspect. A little less sentimentality and a bit more insight into the dystopian society could have elevated this movie to world-class status. As it stands, it remains a very intriguing experience, but the potential was greater. The originality and unpredictability are something contemporary Hollywood sorely lacks. I recommend this film to anyone who wants to see what's possible with imagination and an open mind - it's worth watching for pretty much everyone. It's simply good entertainment, even if it doesn't quite reach the depth it could have had."},

What was a great move, in my opinion, was separating the story lines into chapters, although not in chronological order, as it helps the audience to keep track of all the connections that are happening on the screen. Ayse Polat, the director, cleverly ended the first chapter with a huge cliffhanger that makes the viewers wanting to know more from the story and where its going. Eventhough some questions raised in the beginning are left unanswered and the audience needs maybe a little bit more imagination and power of visualization to put the puzzle pieces together in the end, I would say it is still a film worth watching because of its extraordinary approach."},

While the general knowledge of Winner's deeds is widely known, I shall refrain from divulging the film's revelatory essence to preserve the enigma. \"Reality\" abstains from taking a definitive stance on Winner's actions, leaving room for subjective interpretation (although many may find themselves sympathetic to her motives, if not her methods). The fate of the actual Reality Winner remains shrouded until the film's unveiling. This introspective drama hinges entirely on the power of dialogue and the nuances of human reactions, demanding exceptional performances. Sydney Sweeney, in what could be deemed a career-defining portrayal, masterfully embodies Reality. Embracing a role devoid of glamour, Sweeney effortlessly exudes a profound vulnerability, an often-underappreciated skill in actors. As Reality's understanding of her situation deepens, her transformation becomes increasingly believable. \"Reality\" refrains from passing judgment, instead meticulously presenting the events and their unfolding. The stellar performances of the two central leads elevate the narrative, infusing it with exceptional authenticity. The weight of tension grips you from the outset, immersing you in a palpable atmosphere. Patience is a virtue required, for those seeking swift gratification may find themselves unfulfilled. Sydney and Josh deserve commendation for their captivating portrayals, leaving an indelible impression. Ultimately, the veil lifts, offering an insight into the FBI's interrogation techniques. A peculiar yet effective approach unfolds, as they seek not a straightforward confession but rather a manipulative dance of intimidation. The film unveils the inner workings of such interrogations, leaving you with a disconcerting awareness. Among the finest performances of the year, \"Reality\" presents a riveting and gripping experience. Personally, I found myself captivated, fascinated by its enigmatic allure. If you yearn for adrenaline-pumping action and violence, this may not satisfy your desires. However, I truly recommend it because it deserves a deep endorsement."},

Frustrated by seeing the reality being denied on Fox TV her tipping point was when Trump sacked FBI Director Comey. Ironically this led to her arrest by the FBI and prosecution. In spite of findings by a Senate Committee that her leak was in the public interest, Reality was sentenced to six years in prison. The film is based on the FBI interrogation transcript which was recorded on the day of her arrest, interspersed with posts from her Instagram account and TV news footage. Reality is played by Sydney Sweeney. The transcript comes to life as Reality is confronted by FBI agents, the first two playing good cops, who tell they realise that she just made a mistake, show concern for her animals, chat about cross training. A Master Class in how to get a confession when you haven't advised a suspect of their rights, just having a chat. There are some comic scenes, a cat being under the bed where Reality keeps a gun, another cat observing developments whilst seated in a child's pedal car across the street. But the tension builds as the agents get Reality to talk, I knew the outcome but the narrative still unfolds like a thriller. Well worth watching. Directed by Tina Satter, from a screenplay by Satter and James Paul Dallas. It is based on the play which Satter previously staged as Is This a Room. 8/10."},

Also the glitching of the characters when they are reciting a redacted part of the transcript comes across as overly dramatic and out of place.

Nope, nothing like. That is the real name of a woman (Sydney Sweeney) who worked for the American government translating Iranian documents. She arrives home one day to find \"Garrick\" (Josh Hamilton) and \"Taylor\" (Marchánt Davis) parked on her lawn with a warrant to search her, her home, her car... She's bemused and a bit nonplussed, especially as her visitors seem way more concerned about the wellbeing of her cat and her dog! Anyway, into the house they eventually go and the interrogation begins. For a while, there is quite an effective intensity to that process and using, as it does, the original transcript of the interview as it happened, it delivers an authentic looking presentation of just how effective these agents can be. It's history, so there's no jeopardy - and I think Sweeney turns in quite a strong performance as the plot thickens but it all takes far too long to get going and the production is all just a bit too staccato. The thread does go some way to revealing the intimidatory powers of Uncle Sam when he feels aggrieved and that makes for uncomfortable watching at times. It isn't an especially memorable drama, and it doesn't need a cinema - but it will be fine to watch on the television whilst posing a few questions about what is or is not in the \"public interest\"."},

I prefered L'EMPEREUR DE PARIS however, for the nearly same settings and overall atmosphere, though not the exactly same period: 1800's for Jean François Richet's film and 1900's for this one. Apaches were the young hoodlums in Paris, suburb ghettos in the early 1900's. The main good thing about this film is that it is not cheesy, but tragic, sad.

It's easy to immerse oneself in her world, although part of it is left to the viewer and their interpretation and experience. The costumes are great and realistic (at least they look authentic to me), some minor problems with props that are not from that time at all, but since they are not essential to the plot, I noticed and forgot about them in the same moment. The previously mentioned music, not from that era, didn't bother me; somehow it really fit well with the scenes. The only thing that bothers me is that not all characters are fully developed, making it very difficult to understand all aspects of their lives and actions.

It leaves you with a feeling that can't be described but felt. The longing to be with someone or someone's love has been portrayed beautifully. The character of Roy who's carefree amd unaware of the practicality of this world vs. That of Christy's who has seen how hard and cruel reality is. The director in my opinion was successful in depicting that spark when we fall in love and at the same time the helplessness. The ending is also perfect. Not everything needs to be spoonfed to the audience. We all can have our own opinion on why Christy didn't accept it in the end. The last shot on the beach was just amazing.

Grace Point is the kind of film that sneaks up on you - emotionally rich, visually stunning, and anchored in real, human stakes. Director Rory Karpf does an incredible job balancing intensity and vulnerability. He trusts the story and the characters enough to let quiet moments speak loud, and the result is something that feels deeply personal and universally resonant. The cinematography by Al Francesco is next-level. Every frame feels intentional - from the stark beauty of rural isolation to the intimate close-ups that really let you feel the weight these characters are carrying. It's not just a good-looking film - it's a film where the visuals are doing narrative work. And huge props to Corey Frost on the edit - the pacing is tight, the tension builds naturally, and the emotional beats land exactly where they need to. It's one of those rare indie thrillers that doesn't rush or drag - it just flows, scene to scene, with total confidence. Bottom line: Grace Point is a must-watch. Gritty but heartfelt. Stylish but never showy. Just a damn good movie, made by filmmakers who clearly know exactly what they're doing\nRead More Reviews."},

The problem is that they aren't very good, and they leave the viewer expecting much more than they promise. In this case with \"Who Are You People\" it's simply just another cliche with a predictable storyline you can guess in the first half hour. Ironically, the younger actors seem to bring more nuance and interest to the film than the older actors who come off as wooden and vapid. There's is obviously a reason why Alyssa Milano never did much more than a TV sitcom. And that doesn't help the predictable storyline in this case. I'm sure there will be some who enjoy this type of cliche, and sometimes even I enjoy them. But it's hard to do that in this case with they was it was all presented.

As I watched, I asked myself and my wife about the things we might do if we ever discovered we had an acutely terminal illness. It was with great interest that I discovered there is a HUGE difference in perspective between genders, and this film shows what a woman might consider. Some things were totally apropos, others...not so much. Some of the concepts stick, others are a little more obtuse or perhaps out of place, but this film definitely has its own viewpoint, and if there are any real gripes or misgivings about the broad range of the story, the performances more than make up for that. The film is shot and directed well, and there were good laughs to be had throughout...which to me, makes for a successful comedy. 3 1/2 stars."},

The core storyline is a fresh new perspective, something that I've not seen before in any other movie. Let's start with its core. At the heart of this film lies a narrative that is daringly original and invigoratingly refreshing. So, if you think you've seen it all, think again. This is not just another movie; it is a ground-breaking odyssey that dares to tread where others haven't. Every twist and turn in the storyline is a masterstroke of creativity, challenging conventional wisdom and presenting viewers with a fresh perspective that will remain etched in their minds long after the credits roll.

Concentrated on feeling and thinking and trying to understand our connection to the universe and the way people came to life, live, die and how their spirit continues in the next life. After the experience with the eyes closed (part 2), very similar to 2001 but much less impressive. This also applies to the next phase of life in part 3, the ghost of grandma Mon reincarnated in a goat. There the depth of the 1st part completely evaporates. Spirituality and the essence of life and death completely dissolve in the superficial way of life and thinking of the people in the Zambian village. The disappearance of the goat into thin air fits well into the complete nothingness of the 3rd part of the film."},
{"movie_id": "tt21909682", "reviewer_name": "CinemaSerf", "review_date": "Jan 18, 2025", "review_score": "7", "review_text": "Apparently, in Sanskrit the word \"Samsara\" can mean both wandering and world and is generally used in the context of the reincarnation of a soul from one body to the next. That's what this engaging drama attempts to explore and explain over a couple of hours that contrasts quite remarkably the different approaches to the same end product taken by folks thousands of miles apart. From the monastic existences in Laos to far away Zanzibar, and using completely differing religious conduits, we see just how communities look at death and grief, but not as western cultures would perhaps identify them, but as merely stepping stones from and to somewhere else. Maybe better maybe worse - but certainly new, and not necessarily local, either. It's a simple philosophy that has stood these peoples in good stead over many years of war, oppression, famine and yet they still retain an optimism and an humanity that's positive in a pragmatic as well as a dogmatic manner. It's also quite quirky at times using an hybrid of styles of imagery (beware an hour or so in if you're photosensitive) and some quite enlightening conversation with and amongst ordinary people. At times it's borderline soporific, at others lively and vibrant - but what I found most of all is that it invites people to think. I haven't a religious bone in my body, but this isn't really about religion - or even faith, per se. It's about spirit and a community with our surroundings - and though I think it is too long, it's a film that leaves you with something to think about."},

The lives of Buddhist monks could have been explored more, I was interested in that, didn't know that they can do a sort of apprenticeship and then return to civilian life. Also it was funny how they were using smartphones, I guess I have a skewed idea of holiness and complete seclusion and maybe that's not the case. Visually it has some nice shots, for instance the shots with the monks in orange robes at the waterfall. The elephant out of nowhere. The second part, in Africa, was more colourful and dynamic and almost documentary-like. Mon became Neema, it was nice. Also the red starfish was a nice insert. The reincarnation concept didn't wow me in this movie, it was clearly laid out, but I took this more as insight into the lives of simple people living at opposite ends of the world.

The most disappointing this about this film is the poor image quality. There are some beautifully composed well-framed shots but the picture quality is poor. This film is about death... and it nearly killed me. Boring, intolerably slow, it gets praised only because it's about poverty-stricken people. It's like everyone feels compelled to say this is profound because it's so 'foreign.' In truth it's a miserable long-winded documentary that labours it's thin philosophical offering. As an attempt to bring reincarnation to life (bad pun intended) it succeeds mainly in inducing coma. From a western perspective it certainly offers some insight into very different cultures but it's just bad story-telling. The flimsiest thread holds the whole thing together."},
{"movie_id": "tt22180518", "reviewer_name": "CinemaSerf", "review_date": "Mar 6, 2024", "review_score": "7", "review_text": "If you're expecting some Bee Gees or Donna Summer here, then you're going to be disappointed. Indeed there's precious little disco at all in this story of \"Alex\" (Franz Rogowski). He and his friend \"Mikhail\" (Michal Balicki) have a cunning plan to get from their home in Belarus to Poland and then on to France where they may eventually gain citizenship by joining the Foreign Legion. That doesn't quite go to plan, but eventually he finds himself at boot camp and destined for a mission to Niger. It's there that the local \"MEND\" militia are demanding an end to the cavalier exploitation of the delta by oil companies leaving a trail of death, destruction and pollution behind them. A violent encounter with local leader \"Jomo\" (Morr Ndiaye) in a river ends up having quite a profound effect on our soldier, one which he must come to terms with when he returns to Paris and meets the enigmatic dancer \"Udoka\" (Laetitia Ky) - who would appear to be as connected with his recent past as with his present. The story itself is but an incomplete section of his life, it's the photography that makes this more interesting. The use of night-vision imagery, especially in the jungle, works well as does the presentation of the environmental carnage being left behind - oil leaking everywhere, discarded or bombed out pipelines. That sense of the invasive nature of industrial development is quite cleverly carried onwards as \"Alex\" and his colleagues themselves have little investment in anything but survival. There's not a great deal of dialogue - wanted or needed, and this is the sort of part Rogowski does well - he's neither here nor not a lot of the time. It has a slightly surreal look to it, and though maybe it does meander a little - it certainly does repeat itself now and again - it's still quite a compelling mix of the political and the emotional, and is worth a watch."},

Vicky Knight shines brithly in the leading role with her rusty voice and cockney accent as she works her way through every part of Franky's story. From childhood trauma (both physical and mental), dealing with loss, discovering your true self and your sexuality (LGBTQ+), losing a family while gaining a new one \"Silver Haze\" presents a clear vision in all its aspects and leads the audience to a perfect closure at the end.

Anyway, unable to hold down any kind of meaningful relationship she cruises through life until she encounters \"Florence\" (Esme Creed-Miles). This is a bit of a bolt from the blue for her as she falls completely and the two abscond. Their time together is turbulent at times, but it does give them the opportunity to plot revenge. Is that what \"Franky\" really wants though? Has she just become so hard-wired that she can't learn to move on? Things begin to recalibrate when she discovers that her beloved nan \"Alice\" (Angela Bruce) has cancer and rather predictably, the histrionics all calm down and the story rather loses it's spark. Aside from a rather odious scene on a bus - which may well be based on true events in London - the rest of this is an unremarkable love story (it's in no way a romance) that follows a bunch of unlikable characters about whom I couldn't care less after about twenty minutes of stereotypical and foul-mouthed characterisations. The acting is fairly visceral, to be fair, but it's presented in pseudo-documentary style some of the time then in a more straightforward form of drama at others with neither really engaging.

This must be the best ever Indian movie I have ever seen ever. This is the kind of movie I was waiting for, from Bollywood. Have we come of age? This HAS to be watched in theatres. This is Panchayat meets Kill Bill. Such storyline, I am suddenly proud of Indian Cinema. An extremely sensitive subject of Naxals has been chosen here, and the government's lust for development, leading to rapid decimation of our forests, ecology and all the good things which nature ever gave us. The entire theatre was silent, eerie silent the entire movie, on the edge, goosebumps. This is first ever moment I have seen Indian public just sitting quietly, not moving because we were so moved internally, almost for about 5 minutes after the movie finished. So this is the next movie after GOW & Rang de Basanti, in my my Bollywood hall of fame. Anyways this will not be sent by India for Cannes/ Oscars, but some random garbage from Bhansali or Karan Johar, as usual and embarrassing themselves internationally. Anyways, so this movie has to be seen. Don't go with small kids as there is gore at a few places. Also, what sorcery is this - I see people saying great things about this movie in other reviews but giving less rating? They don't want others to watch this movie? My rating is 20/10. And this is coming from someone who is allergic to Bollywood."},

Very dull boring movie waste of time. It does make any sense, it feels like short film stretched too far for no reason. The plot is weak dull making the viewers irritating rather than sympathizing with the character. It reminds me of 80's those so called art film makers many making movies with average looking actors revolving around poverty and getting favourable reviews from critics for making intelligent movie and no one watching it. Today those same movies looks below average. Over all dissapointing if you are watching it for manoj."},

Vicky Knight is a wonder as Franky, a young nurse from working class London who was burned horribly in a building fire as a child, an event she still feels was done on purpose and seeks the perpetrators of, who may be painfully close to home. She strikes up romance with another young girl (Esme Creed-Miles) on suicide watch in the hospital she works in, a turbulent coupling of two souls who have both been through unimaginable trauma and begin to find a modicum of solace in each other, before life has new curveballs to throw both of them. This is a heartbreaking film that doesn't rely on sentimentality to get its point across and make you feel something, it's all about the actors here and they are stunning. Knight was in a fire for real, her scars are genuine and she uses her experience to haunting effect here, giving a multifaceted, mesmerizing turn. Miles has the more difficult role and her character is often easy to judge or dislike, but we the audience know almost nothing of her past beyond the fact the she is a runaway who ended up in the suicide ward, she gives subtle hints in her challenging, thought provoking and searingly human performance. This is a film of unbelievable depth, uncommon emotional complexity and hypnotic, gorgeous London atmosphere, its only Polak's third feature as a filmmaker and she has already achieved what some artists strive for their whole career. A brilliant film, one of the best so far this year."},

The night I began watching Silver Haze I paused it about 40 minutes in and left it for about two weeks. It was the Florence character which disturbed me, and when I finally finished the film I felt utterly vindicated for being hesitant at seeing what happens with her. The signs were there early that this is a tragic person--what I would diagnose superficially as having symptoms consistent with borderline personality disorder. She says she's a bad person early in the film, and it brought a tear to my eye. The scene where she flips and tells the woman she's fallen in love with that she doesn't like her anymore made me ball shamefully, because it is so familiar. The splitting, the nature of love/intimacy to a borderline person is fleeting and turns as quickly to disgust as it developed into love. It's unstoppable, and I felt for both of them, especially Florence. It's one thing to be able to walk away from her, it's another to be inside her, feeling that always. Love and disgust are far too fluid for borderlines, this is something inescapable, and it's the reason why we're labeled by others and consider ourselves 'bad people', and why relationships are difficult at best. I am really happy that I watched it and I'm equally happy I left the final 40 for a time when I was better equipped to handle the content. 8/10."},

I also liked that it didn't have all the suspense scenes all at night and in the dark, which almost every thriller movie does. And the story is solid and relatable.

If anything, I believe what the movie really lacked was good transition visuals. The movie jumps around in the timeline, but the edits for the transitions weren't great, which could cause some confusion and possibly a disliking for the movie overall. Although as I said, the plot was great. Kept me on my toes, not to mention the acting was amazing! I definitely recommend watching for a spooky, chilling vibe."},

When it's the end of the story, you will want to watch more of it and thus story remains with you, even after the end. And you wonder, what is going to happen now?

However, hugging Devashish Makhija (The Director of the Film) immediately after watching the film for a long 4 mins helped calm my nerves for sure.

That is until he is walking along a country path and encounters a lady (Liyo Gong) examining the mosses that grow freely. They have met before - in her aunt's Chinese restaurant, briefly, amidst a thunderstorm and he is intrigued with her scientific endeavours. She explains to him what she is doing and why, informing him that mosses were the first plants ever to grow on the Earth. The next few hours see him diverted from his mission to go collect his car, and for the two to share their afternoon together. Might anything come of it? Well, that's not really the point. Instead, this seems to be a gentle reminder of how much easier, especially when empowered by the power of his vegetable soup, it is for people to engage with easy other or friendly and curious terms. It's a momentary observation of not just human existence, but it also showcases the beauty of nature as it exists amidst our man-made concrete and brick environment. The rain also seems to serve an almost allegorical purpose, wiping the slate clean for another episode in his solitary yet open-minded and friendly life. It is a strangely compelling film to watch. There's no beginning, or end - just a middle, and the two actors deliver plausibly imbuing a certain not easily definable chemistry."},

It is what Reygadas, Martel, or Antonioni once tried to do, without reading workers' poetry that does not exist, the verses that go in their lunchboxes every day, that go in their little juices and their lunch of white rice with stewed whatever-it-is, and in the plastic bag of a Romanian worker in Brussels who makes soup... Do you know how many species of moss there are in the world? I do not know, but in the film they tell me there are thousands. The mosses are not worried about global warming or droughts, or that some rich idiots are humiliating the existence of indigenous people, through soldiers who cost a dime. There are the mosses, in unusual places, spreading life. And let what must happen, happen. Anyone want to see it while people goes to see «Superman»?"},

Taking place during her farewell tour during 2018, Baez is interviewed & provides archival photos & film about her rise from a little girl who liked to sing & managed to parlay that love into a career in the burgeoning folk music scene. Chronicling the rivalry she had w/her sister (who embarked in her own career as a singer even though dance was her calling) & also the men in her life which included Bob Dylan (who was at the beginning of his career) & a freedom fighter for change who was jailed for a spell, Baez manages to carve out a niche for herself by doing her own thing for many years singing her songs & even becoming a staple in the civil rights movement as she was at Martin Luther King's I Have a Dream speech in Washington DC in 1963 & even arrested herself for taking a stand. Always keeping an upbeat eye to her role in her own career (her one misstep, in her opinion, was her appearance at an Amnesty concert in the 1980's she participated in where we see her perform Tears for Fears' \"Shout\") where she still packs in the audiences who appreciated what she has always done."},

The film appears to start out as a tour film of Baez last tour in 2018 at age 78. But it really becomes and incredibly honest and intimate behind-the-scenes examination of her life as well as her music. She shares intimate details of her relationship with Bob Dylan and her husband David Harris. But really the focus in more on her and her struggles with depression and anxiety - subjects that are often hidden from public view. There was clearly a lot of darkness behind her beautiful voice. Some of the parts of the film related to the dysfunction in her family are deeply disturbing. The film also journeys through the connections between her music and her political activism."},

To put a topical spin on this, I'm going to mention the \"Satanic Panic\" referenced in the last \"Stranger Things\" series. The panic that Dungeons and Dragons was introducing children to witchcraft and Satanic ritual was only the start. There was another converging phenomenon, of therapists recovering memories of their patients' childhood under hypnosis. It would start with sexual abuse, but there were also several extreme cases where therapists continued hypnosis sessions until the patients started remembering being part of Satanic rituals as children, where other children were sacrificed in Black Masses. This became part of several lawsuits and unfortunately not all the parents were declared innocent right away. There was several years of recovering their reputations as well as having sentences overturned. However sad, there were also many cases that did not rise to such extremes. These were later categorized under \"False Memory Syndrome\". The therapists were very motivated to find reasons for patients adult dysfunctions in childhood, the patients eager to please therapists and have them solve all their psychological problems. The two motives converge and patients start vaguely remembering abuse, even without hypnotism these false memories can bubble up. And, of course, the patient is alienated from parents, and has to turn to their therapist, and the mental health system generally as kind of \"substitute parents\". The power rush for the therapist is intense, the patient turns to them for replacing the parent figures who have problably been with them their whole life. This is a serious problem, that continues to go on, in a country that has a generally substandard mental health care system, with many substandard therapists and inadequate therapist education. Does Joan have one of these therapists? Is she being misled about her parents? There's no way of knowing from this documentary, or probably any documentary. Is it a real problem that under-recognized? Absolutely. Tragically."},

Maybe this is my inherent bias, but I really don't like Vincy Aloysius's acting. And in this movie, there were times went she, let's say, went full psycho, which wasn't really required for the role. Other times she held fort, but those moments really spoiled it for me. The male protagonist was okay, so we're the rest of the characters. Another criticism was that the movie was unnecessarily slow and laggy in parts where it didn't need to be. Also, the transformation of the male lead into the villain was quite abrupt and incomplete, I felt Roshan Andrews's character in Kappela was better written and executed. This felt like a bit of a miss. Had high hopes, but wasn't happy with this movie."},

Some very nice cinematic moments as we see the night views of Dublin. It has some noir to it. A bit of a whodunit. I cherish B-movies at times due to the wide net of appeal, bulging budgets, and cliché storytelling of AAA titles. On most occasions, this style of movie is more in-line of film as art. Great acting by the lead. The rest are good enough. Story could be more playful to the whodunit element but works. Maybe it is too much content with the multiple storylines for the length but, the length is refreshing. Easy to digest. I rated against the totality of films I have seen and rated from City Lights to The Deer Hunter to Anchorman. Maybe it's a 7. Watch it if you like mystery, detective, thriller, suspense, noir. I would like to see at least a sequel. Perhaps a trilogy. After all, character's with their name in the title often get sequels these days."},

The only redeeming feature for her in this movie was her opposite, Andrew Richardson who gives an utterly charming, subtle and warm performance. Perfectly tuned for a RomCom. She's lucky he turned up. Harden and Quinn manage their participation as well as you'd expect these two seasoned veterans to do. While Quinn came out strongest (and most grounded) Harden occasionally gives off a slight disconnect here and there.

Wife is preoccupied with housework. Their young daughter is in her room studying, with the door shut. But is she really studying? No. She covertly sends her nude videos to her paramour, who threatens to make these viral if she does not indulge in prostitution. Ultimately she has no option but to commit suicide. Such occurrences are on the rise. Teachers, security guards, cops and hostel wardens are all involved in this appalling scam. Tamil movie #Bakasuran deals with a pertinent topic and boasts of good performances. It certainly needs to be watched by all pubescent women. Running time needs to be reduced by 20 minutes.

The edit points are abrupt and it was just cut in the middle of action. The daughter character wears the same costume in majority of her scenes. The casting could have been better and staging is very bad. The Director seems to have taken just the plot and made emotional only where it needed. The setting look bad in the first half when the character says your brothers daughter died by suicide.

As a big fan of Selvaraghavan's work, I've seen most of the movies he has directed. However, I have to say that he is not a good actor. Additionally, I found the movie script to be outdated and regressive in some ways. While it's true that giving mobile phones to young children is not advisable, considering gadgets and mobile phones as inherently evil is a misguided perspective. In reality, gadgets have made our lives better in many ways. Of course, moderation is key, and promoting violence and killing in is never acceptable."},

Couple of examples: unmatching license plates on the front and back of the car. Car being brand new (probably a rental, still have \"no smoking\" stickers on it) yet the boyfriend refers to it as \"it took me a long time to pay for it\", the police tells the girl \"you and your boyfriend\" although she never mentions she has a boyfriend and that doesn't seem weird to her, etc, etc. With all these add up it is very hard to get engaged in the story. Another goof is when they stopped at the side of the road he says \"we should call your dad tel him we'll be late\" but they have not even decided to even take a break at that point.

But then we get a very quick glimpse into a lovestory between two people that would never be together in real life. I can't get over the two main characters... a chubby, older male that lacks bravery and begs his woman to not leave him alone when he is injured, and a younger model-esque woman with huge lips and an engorged chest who says multiple times that her only reason for living is to be with her man, who is her \"fiance\". Why not make them married, especially since they are having a baby. Thats just one of the many minor mistakes that make this movie so offputting. I mean, there are major mistakes too, but all the minor mistakes make it completely unbelievable. I also noticed that the couple in the diner consists of an older man and a model-esque partner that is 20 years his junior, two people that do not look like they would be in a real relationship together.

If you want a nice little Twilight Zone type movie with little to no gore or violence, then this is for you. The Fearway is what micro low budget independent filmmaking is all about, and that's not a bad thing. The two leads do a great job (Especially Shannon Dalonzo) despite being a little mismatched. They could have easily done away with the \"High School Sweethearts\" in the script which isn't very believable. But because they convince the audience they're really in love, it can be forgiven. Perhaps too much dialogue and slow at first but gets interesting once they first arrive at the diner. (Its never clear what happened to the other patrons sitting in there.) The villain is not scary at all, but again that's because of the low budget more than anything else. A big goof is the rent-a-car no smoking stickers on the drivers side window. Why didn't they take these out in post or just roll down the windows when shooting. This scores a home run with some great award caliber cinematography of the desert vistas. The movie could have used at least one really good shock scene, but that never happen. Not a classic by any means, but most independent movies aren't. I've seen a lot worse. Perhaps the best compliment I could give The Fearway is I would watch it again."},

An entertaining film for sci-fi fans and \"speculative fiction\" aficionados. A trip through the desert gets loopy and existentially dark. Enough said. On Amazon, it's given three (out of five) stars, but it's better than that. I stumbled across it in the seemingly endless queue of suggestions, and was immediately hooked. I had just spent $30 for the latest Insidious film and snacks and left halfway through. Bummed. Let's get the actors and writers back to work to encourage the best work.

I thought this was close to the worst movie I have ever seen, but about halfway through I got the idea that this was some sort of satire, and if you watch the end credits it even states that. But, while the dialogue is awful, it is also a bunch of lines from different movies, and the characters have similar names as villains in other movies."},

I am so happy for her to get a role in a Bollywood movie. Kusha Kapila in Selfiee movie and Dolly Singh in Double XL movie-these girls have really won over a thousand fans over Internet, must admit, to get their steps in a big insertion in Bollywood industry.

This is what made this film very interesting. You just hung on to see what would happen next! The best parts were the one-on-one engagements as it showed a good deal of sincerity and some acting depth. It's not 100% across the board as there is still some excessive drama but the main characters and most of the supporting cast do a credible job. Unlike Bollywood's action film, there are really no gaping holes in the storyline. Personally, I can do without the song-and-dance but I guess that's Bollywood. Anyway, see this movie if you like acting."},

If you really want to go to the theaters and have a fun time. Then this movie is definitely worth it. Raj Mehta truly creates movies with emotion. Akshay Kumar shines as Vijay Kumar. As always, he put up a great performance. He had competition with Emraan Hashmi. Playing the middle class average man, Emraan truly makes his character his own by giving off such a great performance as the superfan. The first half was well done and the second half does have a bit of flaws in it. But it finishes strong leaving you with a fun family entertainer. The female leads didn't have much to do here. They didn't get much screentime which was dissapointing. Overall you can't tell who did better, Akshay or Emraan as they both hit it out of the park by perfecting their avatars in this film. The on screen chemistry of the two was felt and you really just get lost into the film with its compelling and unique story. Go to theaters and support this film!!!"},

I knew what I was getting into, so I wasn't shocked by how inept it was--I doubt anyone who chooses to watch it would be surprised about that. Most folks who seek this out will be wanting laugh at how bad it turned out. Well, it's hard to imagine a movie could be any worse. The story is so poorly told, it makes The Room look well-structured. The basic plot is simple enough, but the way it unfolds is very hard to follow along with. There are absolutely no filmmaking techniques that will help the viewer understand anything that is happening. And the performances are so poor that unless someone states something implicitly, you don't know what they are doing or thinking. Neil might have had it worked out in his head, but he has no ability to communicate his intentions. I really beleive that for a person to put in the time, money, and effort to produce something like this, they must have some kind of impairment. I don't know if it was a brain injury, a developmental delay, or some other form of neurodivergence, but not only is Neil afflicted, I think that anyone who appears in his films must be, too. I can't think of any other reason a person would allow themself to perform the way these people do--not for money, not for acting experience--not even if they were being blackmailed. I haven't even gotten into how visually assaultive this movie is. Anyone who rates this higher than a 1 is only doing so to be funny.

As for the fighting, well, if there was a choreographer on set, they really need to be looking at taking their career in a completely different direction.

There were so many issues with this movie it's not even worth my time to repeat any of them. Just read the other 1 Star comments that are here if you want to know more. From bad acting to a story line that leads in multiple directions to so many unnecessary actors, that aren't even required, to the worst plot ever, it just made for a REALLY bad movie. I wouldn't recommend anyone watching this movie unless you really have absolutely nothing else to watch and are forced to watch it. Definitely DO NOT PAY to see this movie as you will just be wasting your money and time. Who ever signed off on the release of this movie should be fired and never allowed to work in the movie industry again. As far as the director and editor the same goes for them as well.

The chances are that you did not stumble randomly into a Breen movie. You know exactly what you are getting yourself in for - an experience of a lifetime. And his latest film delivers exactly that, and yet so much more. In \"Cade: the tortured crossing\", Breen nonchalantly dismisses conventional movie making practices, disregarding trivialities such as continuity, plot, character development, credible special effects and effective editing. Instead, Breen boldly challenges our notions of cinematic entertainment with a 96 minute tour de force of insanity that will leave you questioning why you even got out of bed this morning. Breen masterfully uses computer editing techniques to produce some of the most breathtaking martial arts battles ever to be captured on camera. While some critics argue that this film could have been made by inept high school students, they simply do not understand what Breen brings to the cinematic table. Breen's genius lies in his ability to create extremely low-quality, low-cost films that somehow manage to become cult classics regardless of how bad they are. Yes, its true - this film is a disaster in terms of production quality. The film was shot entirely on a blue screen, using only five or six backgrounds for the whole production. Shots are held for too long, the dialogue is barely audible and rarely makes sense, and the music is too loud. There are few sequences where more than four shots are linked together logically.

There is a good performance by Cuba Gooding Jr. But the editing of his dialogue scenes are quite weak. As for the acting of the rest of it, other then the immortal Bruce Dern's scene is so abysmal its hard to watch. The fight/action scenes are poorly choreographed, and camera angles are so clumsy its obviously not realistic. Telling a story like this takes quite a bit of setting up, character history is vital. Yet here this about 4 minutes of history, which has no real connection other then clumsy flashbacks. Trying to make a film like this usually takes multiple rewrites to get the dialogue to flow. This looks like they rushed through it in a few days, or weeks."},

Cuba Gooding Jr has just a small part in this movie, but I like his character. The cinematography, visual effects, and editing are decent, and I think you really should just watch this movie yourself and be your own judge of what you think.

This was by far one of the worst films I've watched in a long time. After an entire hour and a half of nothing and ridiculous dialogue, just to found out that this is nothing but a ghost story about domestic violence. Italian actors at their very worst, I kid you not. It's like watching dress rehearsal for people audition for a part and were cast who knew they was no real paycheck involved. Believe every last negative review because this film was just awful.... UGH!"},

Some stylistic choices were made simply because \"ooh scary\" but which makes no sense whatsoever. For example, the people in this story live in perpetual darkness, like have they even heard about lights? A lady was making some food in the oven in the dark. They plod about in complete darkness like they were vampires (except they're not, they're morons) so while apparently they can function, the audience can't really see what's going on, not that there's anything to see. Don't even get me started on the dialogue. Even the characters seem to have this undertone of, \"omg this is so stupid, but I gotta keep a straight face while saying it\". I walked out of the cinema wanting to punch a tree, kick a bear in the balls and chew on glass to distract me from the fact that I just got raped by this movie. And when you breathe a sigh of relief thinking the movie is at an end, a seemingly better movie only very tenuously connected to the first takes its place for no reason whatsoever than to burn through whatever budget was remaining probably."},

This film doesn't have Oscar worthy performances. The acting isn't so bad that it takes away from the overall movie but it certainly leaves something to be desired. Now that we've got that out of the way. The remaining aspects of the film where actually quite good. I'm a horror fan and I've seen the good, the bad, and the ugly. While this film was obviously done on a smaller budget, at least compared to today's blockbuster standards, the effects are modest but well done. What starts as a simple ghost story soon leads to a film that is a commentary about people who are trapped in abusive relationships, or in situations in which they have no power. If your a horror buff looking for something that is lightly thought provoking and not the standard blood and guts fair. This was a very enjoyable film. The bonus horror short at the end, while not directly related to the events of the main feature, adds a nice surprise."},

Berlin is not Paris and Neukölln is not Nanterre - that area is 25 minutes by subway to city center. A far cry from growing up in da hood classics like \"Fresh\" (1994), this is a series of bro stereotypes: meek German teenager constantly pressured by dysfunctional relatives, immature peers and bloodthirsty Muslims. I'm from the Balkans and even I think that's a tad simplistic. The director comes from a privileged background and has an annoying preachy tendency. The film is to be used as learning material on toxic masculinity in high schools, that gives you an idea what to expect. That being said, it's well made and the acting is very good for a German film. And the pressing motive has meanwhile become very real: German youngsters (and men) feel emasculated and worthless among migrant alpha males."},

The city itself plays a critical role in the story, and as a viewer, you'll have a blast accompanying the group on their journey. The dynamics between the actors are particularly impressive, as the cast is perfectly suited to their respective roles and embodies their characters in a convincingly realistic manner.

Most of all it lacks depth and analysis from politicians and experts from the west on the military and political side leading up to the war. Its a little to much look how great we are who made the movie and the focus of a real documentarian is the subject, not the creator.

A plot capable of surprising, masterful performances by the actors in both the main roles and the supporting cast, intelligent and never mannered direction. But what is most pleasing is that the Italian-ness goes beyond the obvious production and plot details-the setting, the characters, the cultural references- , enriching the dialogues with that typical irony proper to our country: we are brilliant even and above all in moments of crisis, even if there is a decision at stake on which our lives depend. The grade does not go toward 10 only because of some minor shortcomings in the mise-en-scene, such as some details in the key sequence (which nonetheless holds one's breath for pace and twists). An 8, however, is the minimum, well-deserved and full. Let's hope Andrea Di Stefano can return to our country to make a new film in the future."},

It's not just made because of some attention, it's made with heart. You look in the scared eyes of people and feel directly the pain where they go through. The fear of not knowing what will happen next and the bravery that they will not let it happen without defending. This documentary shows how people come from ordinary life's, wearing army clothes and defend families, the land and the freedome of Ukraine against the biggest country in the world. Outstanding documentary of the strongest and bravest people on earth, who resist's against everything who will take freedome from them!"},

It had already begun production as Russia inched closer to invading Ukraine, during a time when nobody really knew what would happen next. Because of this, it first covers the last 20 years of Ukranian political transitions and turmoil, and how the country's desire to become democratic and free has evolved over the last 30 years since becoming independent from the USSR. This is what the first portion covers. Not war, or guns, or explosions, but where Ukraine was during the days before Russia invaded."},

In a time where democracy is challenged, hope & courage emerges. It is bizarre how knowledge can be a deterrent to what is possible, all this time I have studied Vladimir Putin only to find out President Zelenskyy is the true story. This president has restored my hope in democracy, and it is significantly inspirational to see such unity, and strength on the frontlines of Ukraine. My support for this president and country has increased tenfold just by watching this film. Sean Penn is a true journalist, and as he quoted Ronald Reagan's \"To be a good actor, you have to be able to be yourself on camera.\" An unwavering strength this actor holds. Sean Penn is an inspiration and I commend his ability to withstand the politics and offer strictly true human emotional responses to this brutal & unprecedented invasion. I am incredibly proud to be an American and represent the ideology of democracy, but to be Ukrainian right now means to fight for it. We must all refrain from wavering our support to the upmost important mission of our time, freedom. God bless America, and God bless Ukraine."},

His refusal to flee Kyiv and his efforts to rally his country and the world against the invasion won him admiration and support from people around the globe. Despite the challenges and the ongoing conflict, Zelensky's courage and determination have made him a symbol of resistance and unity for many Ukrainians and others worldwide."},

No, the hopeful nostalgics quickly hit the ground of reality, obviously that of our time. No tough 70s cop, a leading actor who, in my impression, initially embodies more of a RomCom prototype, for example. A deliberate break in style? In his role, he is semi-corrupt, disillusioned, tired of everyday life, battered, on the verge of becoming a \"loser\". So after a leisurely and not very meaningful 3/4 hour, i.e. A rather long span, I was ready to set my expectations back to zero for the sake of fairness, let's see what else happens, and suddenly the plot really picks up speed. The dynamics in the middle section are great cinema, the exciting follow-up in the episode no less thrilling. The makers' plan probably worked for me, hats off, a wonderful film with a great script."},

The emotional scenes were not emotional at all and the comic scenes were just bad. Rajpal Yadav did create some good humour but he was only there for 1 scene.

And as much as I love the classic takes on the TF2 world, any serious take on it especially grabs my attention, with Emesis Blue being the finest example of this. The plot is intriguing, the writing is sophisticated, and the animations and cinematography are subtle and striking. TF2 is a game that (even in the lore) fixates on the concept of cheating death, with the Mann brothers' Australium fueled life extension, the Respawn system, and even the Medic making a deal with the devil to prolong his death. But Emesis Blue is a serious examination of the mortality of the character's and how their moral actions bring about consequences. Will they persevere or will their minds fracture? Lastly, the film brilliantly understands how to use psychological horror, with its most chilling scenes not relying on music, or jumpscares, but merely on the silent facial expressions of the characters. We experience the scene as they do. It's a remarkably sophisticated film that pays homage to classic horror films, and keeps me thinking about it due to how rich the plot is. It's a masterpiece, and you should watch it."},

This movie tells people and everyone how a true horror is formed and made. Also this movie is free to watch on youtube, which is amazing considering the fact that its made with a Source Filmmaker, The oldest software of Valve, which is not even being updated at all. Fortress Films reached above and beyond on this film and I think that it deserves a Saxxy Awards of 2023."},

This is a feature length animated film made with passion and love for animation and cinema. To think that this was made with SFM (probably with some nuke magic) was just amazing. There were some super subtle stuff in the beginning like shots breaking camera direction to create a sense of unease, while we watch the events go down from Medic's perspective we get chaotic direction on his shots, which was later echoed by the time loops and hallucinations, and some fantastic match cuts, etc, visually this film was absolutely stunning. On top of that, so many references for cinephiles to enjoy (M, the shining, dr.strangelove, the house that jack built, to name a few) and classic horror visual ques, German expressionism, all the visual elements were so well excecated its honestly shocking. This is a masterpiece built with so much love for cinema I was 100% invested through out the entire film. I work with Maya and making this type of thing in SFM? Insane. This is better than half of the stuff in cinema right now, and Valve should revive the Saxxy award for this. It's well written, well animated, well paced, well shot and well acted, if this doesn't win some kind of award I'm gonna RIOT."},

Even cried in few scenes, don't know why but I connected to the movie. No boaring scenes. One good thing from direction point of view is, every character had importance. Sai Kumar sir great expressions. I saw many positive reviews, most of them said feel good movie and emotional but didn't applause the director. I am still thinking without screenplay and direction how the people well connected to the movie? Dhanush proven again as a correct judge in story selection. This might not be highest collected movie in his career but would become one of the memorable movie. Thanks to GV Prakash. Education means lord Saraswathi. Her music instrument is veena.

Simple and effective story and narration. The hero role could not be played by anyone else but other than Dhanush. There is no mass masala in the movie no unnecessary forcefully induced obscenity or comedy scenes. Yes there is some boring drama in some scenes but to make a average person understand the importance of revolution and education the director chose to use some dramatic scenes, but education alone can not make better humans.. so so called bureaucrat's politicians ...IAS and IPS will not make our lives miserable which should also be made a point in the movies like this.

Because of the vast amount of constant entertainment choices at everyone's finger tips these days, people are constantly trying to find something better the minute something ends. I believe it's a very solid 6.5 movie. Everyone did an excellent job all-around here. It also has a very intelligently written script. Gutzy, tense, not overly mellow-dramatic, and never gets preachy. It definitely delivers."},

She asked Billy Bob Thornton to play Penn's character's father, the figure the story, and novel it's based on relies on, and he's perfect. They're a gift to the film.

Director Sean McEwen has done a commendable job in bringing the true story of the Dougherty Gang to the screen, focusing on the intense bond between the three siblings as they embark on a cross-country crime spree. What truly elevates the film is its ability to create a sense of authenticity and palpable tension throughout. The cinematography is particularly noteworthy, with close-up camera angles that effectively heighten the action during car chases and shoot-outs, making it feel far grander than its budget might suggest. The cast, especially India Eisley, Emory Cohen, and Sam Strike, deliver committed performances that make their characters' desperate choices understandable, even as their actions become increasingly reckless. While the film doesn't shy away from the harsh realities of their criminal escapades, it maintains a focus on the unwavering commitment they have to one another. \"American Outlaws\" is a testament to resourceful filmmaking, proving that a compelling narrative and strong performances can overcome any budgetary constraints, resulting in a thrilling and engaging cinematic experience."},

One thing I had to give to \"Perpetrator\" is that it didn't play it safe and tried to bring new twists into the horror genre. On the other hand it tried to incorporate silly, almost humorous, scenes which felt out of place, instead of some actually creepy and frightening moments it relied heavily on gore and blood, which was more disgusting than scary, and I felt like Kiah McKirnan, the actress in the role of the protagonist, struggled to emotionally connect with her character. What also completely disrupted me from the main horror plot was an unnecessary romantic side-line. I was also very much looking forward to seeing Alicia Silverstone back on the silver screen again, but sadly the role of the mysterious aunt of the protagonist didn't suit her - her hyper-stylized performance fell somewhere between a \"ridiculous witch from a childs fairy tale\" and \"Miranda Priestly from The Devil Wears Prada\".

It should work well, and maybe it does in the play that this movie was based on (I don't know the play), but here the elements don't connect up very gracefully. Part of the problem, I suspect, is that somebody decided to confine the entire plot to a single day. Maybe even to the hour and a half that the movie takes, although I'm not sure we're supposed to take it that literally. Anyway, the supporting characters don't get very well developed (some are virtually stereotypes), attitudes change too abruptly, and the ending is more like a \"we've run out of time\" ending than like a comprehensive development out of what's come before.

But not every time humor is used the result is comedy. In this case humor is here simply to hold the drama in check and stop the entire thing from turning into a melodramatic mush. And it works, we do get a very understated and sometimes even restrained emotional reaction in a story that the normal Hollywood treatment would turn into an overwhelming sentimental tearjerker.

Once again, she gave a magnificent performance. I think she is a great actress and I hope she works in American movies in the future. The movie itself was strange. It is about the Empress Elisabeth (nicknamed \"Sisi\") of the Austria-Hungarian Empire, who was sort of the 19th Century's Princess Diana or Jackie Kennedy. Her cult survives to this day. (There is a whole museum devoted to her in Vienna.) Romy Schneider became a star playing her in a few movies of the early 1960s. A Viennese musical, ELISABETH has been a hit all over Europe. (Cast album is available on the Internet.) These works have dealt with the young Elisabeth and her marriage to the Emperor Franz Josef. The royal marriage brokers were trying to sell Franz Josef on the idea of marrying a Bavarian princess, but he instead fell for her younger sister, Elisabeth. His mother, who was a domineering old battle-axe, made her life miserable, controlling every single thing she did, until Elisabeth finally had the courage to assert her independence. But this movie is about the older Elisabeth, in her 40s, who has, herself, become tough, mean, and sadistic, despite her beauty and charm in social situations. Her many children, including her son who committed suicide, are never mentioned. I have no idea of the historical accuracy of this depiction. This movie opens with Sisi engaging a 41-year-old lesbian to be her companion. This is the role played by Sandra Hüller. They do all sorts of athletic activities together, often causing humiliation and physical pain to the companion, who nonetheless adore her. But sometimes the companion successfully substitutes for her on grand social occasions. Elisabeth loves playing moll to her flamboyantly gay cousin, much to the displeasure of Franz Josef. I can't really write more about this movie without spoilers. I will just say that this movie would make a good double bill with THE BITTER TEARS OF PETRA VON KANT. The movie is well-acted and beautifully photographed, but the anachronistic soundtrack is jarring. I can't say that I liked this movie very much simply because I have very romantic ideas about the real Sisi. But perhaps someone without my prejudices would enjoy it more. This was just not my kind of movie."},

This movie honestly should be called Supergirl and the Legion of Super-Heroes sense she is the main character of the film. Many people dont know who the Legion of Super-Heroes are, so let me explain real quick. Pretty much the are the Justice League in the 31st century. Supergirl is able to get there but a Portal Superman has. She goes there to learn to be a better superhero cuz she is struggling to adjust her new life on Earth. Let me first start by saying this new animation style is BEAUTIFUL. I love it, I also really enjoyed the Super Sons CGI animation they had. But DC is always doing good in the animation department. The voice acting is pretty top notch all around. The only character I didnt really like was Batman. No offence to Jensen Ackles but I dont really like his Batman voice, it sounds like he is trying to hard. The story in this is pretty basic but that can be said about all of DC animated movies sense they are all about an hour and 20 mins long. So we cant get any super deep meaningful story or detailed twist. The Legion is under attack by the Circle and Supergirl has to help to stop them. We get some interesting and cool side characters as well like Brainiac 5 voiced by Harry Shum Jr. Mon El, Timberwolf, Triplicate Girl, Dawn Star ( Which if they ever do a live action version literally cast Cynthia Hamidi the voice actor, she is perfect looking for her. ) The action in this was really good as well. Some solid fights and we get like 8 action sequences through out the film. I also really enjoy the sound design of Supergirl fighting, the BOOMS you hear are a nice touch when she punches. In all this is another solid film from DC. 7.5/10."},

She, replete with multicoloured curly wig is with her mother preparing for a party to celebrate her father's birthday. What we learn from very early on is that her dad \"Tona\" (Mateo Garcia) is very unwell. Indeed, from the brief scene we see of him in the shower - this is a twenty-seven year old not destined to survive much longer. Clearly that information is known amongst the man's family and friends with his sisters, and his father, taking quite distinctly differing approaches to dealing with their impeding loss. The story takes it's time, but it's never dull. The observational nature of the drama, and the hugely charismatic effort from the young Sentíes is enthralling to watch as their day continues revealing stresses, strops, strains and a slightly defiant degree of optimism. As ensemble performances go, Marisol Gasé, Montserrat Marañon and Teresa Sánchez ensure that this well cast and presented story of a family in distress works evocatively. There are few tantrums, just a stoicism and dignity that makes this really quite a poignant story of a young girl - and a family - that doesn't quite appreciate that life is soon to change for ever."},

However, when they're framed within the context of extraordinary circumstances, they take on an added new dimension, as witnessed in the second offering from Mexican writer-director Lila Avilés. This warm, heartfelt, bittersweet comedy-drama tells the endearing story of a family hosting a birthday party for Tona, a young, beloved painter battling advanced cancer (Mateo Garcia Elizondo), told largely through the perspective of his seven-year-old daughter, Sol (Naíma Sentíes), who hopes against hope for her father's recovery. As events play out, viewers watch as Tona's family makes preparations for the celebration - often involving simple tasks told with delightfully funny twists that provide much-needed comic relief - as well as the various means with which his relatives are dealing (or not dealing) with an apparently impending inevitability that no one really wants to address or discuss. Yet what might seem destined to be an exercise in forced festivities with an underlying sense of morbidity turns out to be a loving, earnest celebration of life, despite the undeniable presence of an unwanted, intangible \"guest\" lingering in the background. While the film incorporates a few sequences that are inherently a little too incidental in nature compared to the larger overall narrative, \"Tótem\" nevertheless serves up a charming, touching, authentically presented tale that reaches out to audiences and surrounds them with sincere, loving feelings and a big, well-earned hug. This National Board of Review winner and Independent Spirit Award nominee is a fine, little-known indie gem that will surely move you, even if it leaves you with uncomfortably mixed feelings as its story unfolds. It effectively illustrates that there indeed can be times of boundless, overwhelming joy even in the face of overwhelming lament but that what ultimately matters most is what we make of these circumstances when they play out, especially when it comes to expressing how we feel for those whom we truly care about most."},

And sometimes it does not work. Case in point, this movie. You may or may not like the vintage animation. But in a world that is contemplating locking down entire cities just to save the ecosystem (which is happening today), LEGION OF SUPER HEROES seems like a waste of valuable resources.

I liked the animation style that they went with, although there were times that could feel off as well. However, the real gem of this movie is the relationship and chemistry between Kara and Brainiac 5. A fun enemies to lovers that made me smile even during some of the janky moments. Another win is I really liked the design of the characters of this movie, and I feel like if they focused more on the characters and their personalities and backstories then spending so much time on on a threat that never felt very threatening the movie could have been really good. It definitely needed more build up, but overall it was still enjoyable."},

Then we have a flashback to the recent past, Grace (Jena Malone) learns that her brother committed suicide and has murdered a fellow priest. Not believing that her brother would have done this she makes her way to Scotland and visits an isolated Convent run by an strict and odd order of nuns. After a series of faints she ends up first in hospital and then in the Convent itself after being pulled from the sea. She also experiences visions of the past, Medieval Knights disrupting pagan ceremonies, also of nuns committing suicide. All of the nuns are odd, the sanest one has just plucked out one of her eyes as she had seen the Devil. The Mother Superior (Janet Suzman) believes in One God and His Shadow (Satan) a Dualistic view which is shared by the other sisters and by Father Romero (Danny Huston) who is sent by the Vatican to investigate the deaths. There are many twists and turns in this narrative with flashbacks to Grace's youth and the search for a lost relic. A Templar like Order of Knights are also involved. Are we witnessing Angelic or Demonic powers at work? Naturally there are some gory scenes and further killings. A bit of a slow burner but a mystery/horror film which is well worth watching. Directed by Christopher Smith from a script he co-wrote with Laurie Cook, 7/10."},

Other than this, the movie was wonderfully pleasing to my eyes and ears. I especially liked the group's final performance of the movie, since it showed growth for all the characters, allowing them to prove that they'd adapted and worked hard to become better musicians."},

It's not about a whale, no. It's about the aspirational saxophonist \"Dai\" who heads to Tokyo with dreams of taking over the world. He arrives, unannounced, on the doorstep of his friend \"Tamada\" looking for a bed for a few days. Needless to say, that few days turns out to be a bit longer and their friendship starts to strain a bit (the visitor snores!). \"Dai\" visits a small bar and meets the jazz-loving owner \"Akiko\" who sends him to a live venue where he encounters the pianist \"Sawabe\" whom he tries to convince to form a band. They are both eighteen but the latter man has been playing for about fourteen years longer than his new friend, so is a little sceptical! That doesn't last long once he hears him play and they soon decide they need a drummer to keep both from straying into the uncontrollable territory that can be improv jazz! Well, it turns out that his \"landlord\" isn't half bad at beating time with a stick on a Coke can - but can he up his game and turn this duo into a trio good enough to play at the city's most prestigious club - \"So Blue\"? The story itself is a bit predicable, with a few temper tantrums, frustrations and fallings out but it does illustrate well just how athletic these musicians must be to perform. Hands are covered in calluses and bruises, the sax takes quite a toll on the breathing and at times it's touch and go as to whether they can make it out of the starting block. There's nothing easy about the task they have set themselves nor the dedication and sacrifices it will take to achieve (or not) their goal. The animation itself it a little hit and miss, the CGI works much less well that the hand drawn scenes, but what really works here is the synchronisation with the musicians and that can be really immersive at times. If you are a fan of this genre of music, then you are in for a treat of Coltrane, Stitt et al. The saxophone (Tomoaki Baba), piano (Hiromi Uehara) and drums (Shun Ishiwaka) are unafraid to start off timidly and (especially the drummer) very rough around the edges, but as the story develops and they improve and become more confident, so do their performances until a tragedy tinged denouement that really does get the toes tapping. I'd have to say - there is no point in watching this is if this style of rambling, meandering and frankly rather musically self-indulgent performance doesn't appeal to you, but the powerful mix of frenetically syncopated animation and music I found really quite compelling. Sure, it's a bit long - but it's well worth a watch."},

And, sometimes, it can do both simultaneously, as demonstrated in writer-director Christian Petzold's latest, a searing drama/wry comedy about four old/newfound friends who are unwittingly drawn together at a summer house near the Baltic seacoast. Their time together proves revelatory, stressful and enlightening, in part because of their interactions, the disclosures that come out of those relationships, and the looming threat of ravaging forest fires that threaten them and their existence, both literally and metaphorically. The film is a slowburn in every sense of the word, especially at the outset, with a somewhat cryptic narrative that seems rather meandering at times, but that sets the stage for what's to follow in the back half. The picture subsequently presents a witty but profoundly insightful examination of what makes us who we are, how much we enjoy or endure our lives, and what we can do to make it better for ourselves when we eliminate what no longer serves us. In many respects, \"Afire\" is probably not what most viewers will expect, but, then, that's a huge part of its appeal, a refreshing, engaging look at life and what we make of it, a valuable exercise given how abruptly it can all be taken away, leaving us to ask ourselves, what did we do with the time we had and was it indeed worth it in the end? Give this one time to unfold, and let it sink in. It may help you realize and understand more about yourself than you can possibly imagine."},

Leon is his own worst enemy, always makes the wrong choice, and then beats himself up about it. There is a sinister backdrop to the story, and an unsettling tonal shift toward the end - but that's life, right?

I was first drawn to the music in the trailer and had a feeling about the film's delicate sensitivity and that I would like it. My intuition was correct. The main character is such as interesting leading man, interesting because he isn't a typical protagonist, not particularly attractive, nor charismatic, rather insecure and uncomfortable. For some reason I completely related to him and a viewer would care about what happens to him. (At least I did). (Something important in any good story line). .He is so quiet and yet one senses so much passion inside of him. (I will give no exact details as that would result in \"spoilers\".) Put it this way. He has written or at least is working on a book and very much hopes it will be approved of by his editor and others. This seems to be his major preoccupation and I think how he sees it as potentially affirming his very self-worth and existence. His connections to the people around him seem to shift though out the movie, and one can see his sense of how little he can control or even predict, as if the world and its people are floating and interacting around him. (I just love movies with shorelines of sandy beaches and long wide shots of the sea. Maybe that's why I gave it 10 vs 9 stars! ) There's much more to the movie than this, but I think you should watch it and see what happens and why it is called Afire. No spoilers here."},

The characterisations here have a fluidity to them that makes for quite an interesting watch. None of them could ever be described as beautiful - in any classical sense - so the story is much more about their traits, flaws and foibles than about their looks. That works up to a point, but there was too much missing from the puzzle for me to really find myself engaged with any of them. The last twenty minutes - set amidst some lethal forest fires - was rushed and seemed to me indicative that \"Leon\" wasn't the only one who'd suffered from a writer's block! The photography is effectively intimate at times but at other times we see just too many shots walking to and from the beach (and the constant buzzing of the mozzies got on my nerves a bit, too, after a while!). I did quite enjoy this, but somehow it just lacked substance before a conclusion that just seemed to be unnecessarily ghastly. Give it a go, though..."},

A testimony that why fiction cinema is hurt for filmmakers from all kinds of diverse groups to tell their own stories, for instance, Devid's sexual fluidity, Nadja's mystique and Felix's sensitivity, are, for Yours Truly's money, all far more appealing than Leon's inceldom and tunnel vision.\""},

For an actor barely ten years old, this is a masterful performance from Sofía Otero. It's a complex family drama that deals with relationships and identity in a delicate yet potent fashion as a mother \"Ane\" (Patricia López Arnaiz) leaves her busy husband \"Gorka\" (Martxelo Rubio) behind and takes their three children on a trip to see her family. Outwardly, they are a normal enough family unit - they have a few financial worries and at times relationships can be a bit strained, but as we get to now them all a bit better, we discover that Otero's character - a young boy (\"Aitor\") by birth but not by nature is seeking the confidence internally and from those surrounding to truly become \"Lucia\". Of course this causes consternation amongst the loving, but confused, parents and family at large - apart from her pragmatic and affectionate, beekeeping, great aunt \"Lourdes\" (Ane Gabarain), who seems to appreciate that the choices being made now by the youngster are visceral and innate. The story allows us to come to our own conclusions about how we might deal with this scenario were we ever to face it - as a child, as a parent, as an extended family member - and, rather effectively here, as a best friend. It has an innocence to it and a poignancy that this young actor encapsulates skilfully and engagingly. Arnaiz, Gabarain and Itziar Lazkano as the grandmother \"Lita\" all add depth to the characterisations and the narrative here too. It can be a bit on the slow side at times, but somehow that doesn't detract too much from the considered style of storytelling going on here. It's thought-provoking and well worth a watch."},

John Trengove owes me 2h of his life that he is welcome to serve anytime he wants - whether it be cleaning my house or walking my dog, I am mad i wasted 2h of my life to watch something that is not even a movie because nothing happens. When something does happen, it's so not logical or make even the slightest sense. Next time you want to make a movie just facepalm yourself John Trengove and spare us from doing it ourselves. If you think about watching this movie just do yourself a favor and watch Joker a second time, it will be a much better experience."},

Well, here he is more in the \"flesh\" as he turns up on the doorstep of his long estranged school friend \"Ira\" (Matt Dallas) with his lively girlfriend \"Lilly\" (Maggie Geha). Up until now, \"Ira\" has lived quite happily with boyfriend \"Josh\" (Taylor Frey) but is reluctant to commit to anything more formal. Now, with their unexpected houseguests, the booze starts to flow, the weed gives way to the molly and boundaries start to blur as truths start to rear their ugly heads. At times there's quite an engaging chemistry between Dallas and Cosnett, but the unfolding scenario is a little too contrived and the storyline just starts off weakly before going nowhere fast as the predictability lives up to our limited - and disappointing - expectations at the conclusion. It's sad that it has to reinforce some rather fickle stereotypes along the way, too and in the end it offers little more than an excuse to watch some daytime eye-candy take part in something that looks like it has been sloppily edited for ad breaks. Most of it is filmed in an haze and there's simply nothing new here, sorry."},

The film picked up pace in the last 30 minutes or so. I wish something more had happened in this movie. At times the movie felt disjointed. The performances by all the casr members were good. Simon Baker was fantastic as Travis Hurley. He's in nearly every scene-that's commendable. I watched an interview that mentioned that the movie was filmed in 16 days! That's a tremendous achievement. Guerrilla filmmaking from down under!"},

But my hopes were dashed when I got to the end of the film & realised there was nothing more to it than meets the eye. Nobody does anything, nobody says anything, nothing happens, nothing is resolved. There is no drama, no conflict, no dynamism to the film whatsoever. No character's pulse goes over 60, no emotions arise beyond desolation. A pointless film, much over-praised. Cinematography is wonderful. The actors are top notch and do their best, but there's no screenplay to work off. I will now officially give up on Australian films."},

Marion Cotillard becomes more prominent in the second half of the movie. Zlatan Ibrahimovic is a secondary character, to my surprise, but he elicits a few laughs. The new casting is likeable, but it doesn't quite live up to the old actors' talent and charm, meaning Gerard Depardieu and Christian Clavier were far better as Obelix and Asterix, respectively (too bad they' re too old), and the script is what you'd expect from a standard \"Asterix and Obelix\" movie. It's not super original, but it can hold your interest, and younger kids' as well. Overall, it's not a masterpiece, but it's not a waste of money and time, and it's a generally family-friendly movie, that it's funny enough."},

Twenty years ago a teenage indigenous girl was murdered here, the killer never found. Baker is the cop called in to reevaluate the cold case, a man who has a past so troubling he takes heroin just to cope with the day to day. The locals initially seem less than willing to help given the neglect and indifference of the police overall in this forgotten region, but eventually the brother (Rob Collins) and sister (Natasha Wanganeen in one of the year's best performances so far) warm up to him and express long buried desire to find some closure. Closure doesn't exist in such an open, vast, lonely corner of the world though and the bizarre stone structures and desert dwellings seem to hold secrets in steadfast silence. Baker stays at a motel that is literally carved into a mineral structure underground, his room akin to being on the moon in terms of tone and atmosphere. He resembles someone like Bryan Cranston here, I'm so used to him as the glib clairvoyant dude on The Mentalist, to see him in such a quietly despairing, resolutely rugged characterization is jarring, but in a good way. He has clearly sacrificed a piece of his humanity for the work, and his journey through this hushed desolation almost beckons him to regain some of it by finding a few long hidden answers. Almost. It's a quiet, hypnotic tale unlike many other cop/killer mysteries, where meaning and significance are found in the wavering pauses between words and all the collective pain and confusion that ripples out from a crime like that can be seen in Wanganeen's ghostly, impossibly wide eyes as she, a relative unknown to me, gives some career best work in a fantastic film."},

I fear even today that things have not changed with not believing the victim but I hope it has on some level.

Iv'e seen bettee but as far as im concerned this was still great. For me however the only thing that let this movie down really was the dubbing. I didnt understand why it was overally acted and it therefor made the script sound a little unpolished aswell. But looking past that lets get to the actual film. Its all about this young girl that turns up after being missing for three months. The lead detectives try to find out who was responsible for the capture and within this find out it might be part of even bigger thing. The cast of this movie were good and interesting to watch. The plot was pretty good and was entertaining. Overall a pretty good thriller."},

But there were great ones such as SEVEN of course, the best ever, and several other ones. But this one has nothing to remind of, nothing exceptional to remember. You have the unavoidable detectives duet and the rest is predictable, with the also unavoidable raining scenes, a cliché for serial killers films. No real surprise, if you have seen at least ten serial killer schemes in your life. I prefered THE PLAGUES OF BRESLAU, made in 2018. The only unusual thing is that it takes place at the beginning of the COVID plague, but is it useful to give quality to this flat movie? To enhance the interest to see it? I don't think so."},

Having it take place over the pandemic was also pointless, especially melodramatically naming the days of the lockdown like chapters that are supposed to mean something to the story's significance, because they didn't. Trying to convince the viewers the antagonists motives were a result of the pandemic was a far stretch, even to the best of imaginations. I kept waiting for some big twist or big reveal, and it never came. The entire story was just a waste of 96 minutes. What made this even more frustrating was the abysmal lack of basic policing protocols, because every crime scene both cops were at they had their paws all over the evidence. Did the producers forget that cops are supposed to wear latex gloves at crime scenes? Never mind there's a pandemic going on and they're still touching everything in sight lol. And in the final act when the female cop goes down the shaft, she's breathing so loud and heavy like she was the victim that was scared to death, and not a trained cop. This entire production was amateur-hour and a complete waste of time. It was a pointless and frustrating watch. It's a generous 4/10 for the somewhat believable performances and the decent cinematography, score and tone the film had."},

The beginning of the film is very interesting and thought-provoking, but over time you become discouraged from watching it because you stay in the same place the whole time. The first act is wonderful, the second is very weak and the third could be much better. The outcome ends very quickly and this hinders the development of the investigation. The main characters are always serious and have no charisma, that is, following the two is very discouraging because they are shallow. They even try to delve into these characters by involving their family dramas, but that too is very shallow. Everything is shallow, almost nothing is interesting and that's why this film is so weak and mediocre."},

It begins in march 2020 just as the covid lockdowns were first implemented. A girl who has been missing for nearly 3 months suddenly turns up. She has escaped from her abductors but is traumatised, remembers little. Two detectives who themselves are suffering from family separation due to the quarantines and curfews investigate the case and soon connect it to other missing young people. Strange characters are encountered and the obvious assumption is that a people trafficking gang is at work. But strange symbols are observed and the words of suspects suggest that a Cult with a hidden leader is involved. Sacrifices to appease an Old God, the coming of The End Times are all in the mix with the pandemic itself. The Asturias mountains where the detectives hunt for the Cult members and their victims provide a stark and eerie background. From old farm barns through the woods and pursuit along narrow roads, Cultists determined not to be taken alive must be pursued. Quite violent and gory in parts but much of the horror is psychological. This film could have been fleshed out and would have benefited from a twenty minute extension to it's 97 minute running time. Written and directed by Patxi Amezcua. On Netflix. 8/10."},

No, every single feeling and thought needs to be rammed down our throats through narration just so there can't be a shred of doubt about what the writer means. Even though most of the times the female lead is literally describing what we are looking at! The only reason I'm giving this 5 stars is because there are some moments where I feel the main characters have some chemistry. Mainly when they are being playful and there is witty banter.

The viewer should be able to intuit the feelings of the actor based on their performance ,not hear juvenile inner monologues about how situations have made them react. The false bravado she displays doesn't\nexactly lend credibility to the movie, or her role in it. Ross Butler is the only person in this entire production that doesn't over act or make you under value him as an actor. It was OK, but it could've been so much better.

The pacing is quite good, quality is good and acting is good. Storyline itself has its ups and downs like the movie itself."},

Not only narked, but now homeless! Luckily her pal knows of fellow fighter \"Kayden\" (Ross Butler - think Henry Golding with muscles) who might have a room to spare. Unsurprisingly he's not interested, but after a meet at a fight where things get a little bit heated, she manages to convince him that only with her help can he hope to win out against the more experienced, and ruthless \"Jax\". What now ensues is about as predictable as it gets as they gradually fall in lust - even stopping to get a condom from the drawer amidst some rather comically bouncy sex - before a denouement that you can see from space. Everyone is easy enough on the eye, and some of the fight scenes do convey some of the athleticism, stamina and skill (as well as the ocassional brutality) of this gruelling sport; but the acting is pretty terrible and the whole thing - especially at the end - is hugely over-scripted. It's neither perfect nor addictive, this - really just a mediocre romantic drama at best that you will soon forget."},

They skipped over lots of details, with little to no character development. Some of the dialogue didn't quite fit. It's rated r so the cussing and sex scenes were expected but just a lot of the movie didn't tie into anything at all. The movie is watchable though. Definitely, something to watch to pass the time. Not recommended if you're looking for an actual good romance movie. The fighting was nice. Not well versed in mma or underground street fighting so I can't speak to that world but again everything just felt rushed and all over the place. We really didn't see actual fighting development from the other MC. Overall, a romance action-type thing, a bit rocky ish, but lacks development and expansion in all areas.

Based on a popular manga series, this episodic 2023 Japanese drama (called \"Call Me Chihiro\" in English) picks up the concept of a modern-day free spirit by centering on a former sex worker who decides to work at a seaside bento stand. She doesn't hide anything about her past and in fact, shares her unsolicited opinions to the people who become attached to her. Most of her focus is on a young alienated schoolgirl and an obstreperous little boy being raised by a selfish mother. Leisurely directed by Rikiya Imaizumi, the film starts on a comic note as Chihiro's previous occupation makes her popular with the guys who hang around the bento stand, but then the story turns more melancholic as we get to know the characters around Chihiro. Inspiring them to lead better lives, Kasumi Arimura is affecting as Chihiro, and despite an overlong running time, the movie manages to hit all the right emotional notes."},

The story is an extreme stretch once or gets further into it. The acting is very poor and surprisingly John travolta is the weakest one. Clearly showing if you take long breaks from your craft it does take it toll. Basically Amazon wanted a film entice people and the through alot of money at Kevin and his brand to ensure it gets that \"Kevin harts in it, surely it's decent\". But a very poor film overall. I would rather Kevin go away for a few years with the films and come back and bring back something he was able to really put his effort in. Cannot recommend it, tje only positive is that they kept it under 1hr 30."},

The novel which the movie is based on is not one of them, but when i saw indraðsson's name, i was excited to watch it. But the result is a complete disappointment. I wish i had bought and read the book before. The movie is terrible, and now that i know the plot, i have no desire to read the book. The actors seem to have stepped out of a hollywood c-series movie. So, i was quite happy to see a familiar face in the second half of the movie: ólafur darri ólafsson. He did not surprise me again, he is perhaps the only good thing about this bad movie. With his big body, he makes you think how tired he was on the film set, but even if he was, he never shows any signs of tiredness in the films, he moves so easily within the story that for a moment, one can forget that he is watching something fictional. It can still be watched to kill time, but when you take away a few good things like ólafsson, there is almost nothing left..."},

His sister Rachel was nicknamed Mopey Mopey, but Michael's character Eric was the one who moped around the whole time. He looked beaten down and barely squeaked out an emotion. This was juxtaposed to Sophia Lillis' character Maggie who had no problem showing her emotions. Since Michael's depressing character, Eric, was the protagonist, I had trouble getting through a number of his scenes, including most of his scenes when he was gambling in the shady backroom poker games. It was hard for me to see the man he had become after both of his parents died. From personal experience, after my mother passed away, it was hard to get the brothers back over for family dinners very often. Life got busy, and mom wasn't there to bring everyone together anymore.

Not only is it a very slow slice-of-life film, the main character (Michael Cera's Eric) is so repellent, I just didn't want to spend any more time with him. He is inconsiderate, self-absorbed, cold, oblivious, and shallow. He blows off all these people who made plans to spend time with him in his rare visit, with barely a 'sorry.' Both of his sisters are obviously suffering, and he doesn't even seem to notice, let alone care. He even scolds the one who adores him. At one point, he shows what really matters to him (and it's not anyone else), and asks her why the other sister 'hates him.' The short answer is that he is just a JERK. The real question is why there is anyone in his life who actually tolerates him."},

I identify myself in this story, a very tasty slice of life, it might be slow for those who can't appreciate a good dull but tempting work of art. I'm a big fan of Michael Cera's work (my favorite film is Scott Pilgrim Vs The World) and I think his performance in this footage is really good, he can deliver a good character with his issues and resolutions, some might not like this character due his personality but that's not a movie problem, that's how it's supposed to be. Hannah Gross' performance is heartbreaking, you can really see the sadness and disapointment in her eyes, you really can tell that her character isn't okay. Sophia Lillis' performance warms my heart, every time her character enters the scene I just start to smile unconsciously, definitely my favorite character.

Its craft in storytelling starts strong at the get-go with an in medias res delivery. We enter the story in the middle of some specific scenario between three main characters with history between them. Through somewhat exquisite gradations delivered in a plain and straightforward manner, the film reveals increments of who they are with respect to each other, the nature of their inter-connected backgrounds, and what shades of affinity or tension have existed and continue between them. The essential conflicts and struggles are clear, crisp and relatable, made artfully pleasurable by strong and believable performances across the board, including all the minor characters. Sophia Lillis is the emotional anchor of the film, delivering a layered and wholly winsome performance as the sister who needs and fails to get so much."},

The film tells of the politics behind the war like a decent thriller because sometimes less is more showing emotions of people as they listen to the war through radio communications. As great as Mirren is as Golda, it's the script showing a war but not the details that anyone can keep up with.

It was a good portrayal (historical accuracy unknown) of Golda Meir, the leader of Israel during the late 40s and early 50s. The cinematography was moody, has an appropriate color palette and had many striking shots. The story followed Golda through the tumultuous Yom Kippur War and how she tried to guide her country from annihilation. Mirren was obviously in heavy makeup, perhaps a bit much, but one can flow with it even with her being in most every shot: chain-smoking. Rather than show battle scenes, probably to cut costs, the film effectively uses Meir's emotional reaction to elicit view emotions. Overall, this was a measured and gentle approach to telling these stories as it was driven by discussion dialog. Overall, it followed a modern approach to the historical drama genre."},

With Egypt and Syria massing huge numbers of troops and tanks on the borders, it falls to the Israeli prime minister Golda Meir (Dame Helen Mirren) to galvanise her hugely outnumbered population and to work with her legendary defence minster Moshe Dayan (Rami Heuberger) to stave off this overwhelming force long enough for her to convince American Secretary of State Henry Kissinger (an almost unrecognisable Liev Schreiber) and his boss Richard Nixon to brave the threats from the Soviets and the Saudis and come to her aid. What's annoying about this film is the astonishing lack of substance to the thing. Much effort has gone into Dame Helen's prosthetics, however much of the rest it seems to repetitively follow her walking about from place to place - with her famous white shoes - whilst lighting and smoking a cigarette. We know she is ill, and we also see from her frequent visits for treatment that the adjacent mortuary is testifying to the increasing horror of this invasion. However there's virtually no detail as to who she is/was, how she got the job, how her intelligence was attained, how her skilful combination of diplomacy and courage all helped to save her nation from annihilation. It's all just presented in a second-rate documentary style that was as unconvincing as it was shallow and episodic. Sure, it illustrates well the perils of war - but, to be honest, it could be any war where one nation was up against a larger, more powerful, one. To do justice to this story and this woman, it needed greater focus and much more detail. This is nobody's finest work here, sorry."},

And this is what it is, based on the event of the brief Yom Kippur war of 1973. There is no exploration of Golda Mier's personal journey to becoming the first female PM of the state of Israel, other than a a brief reminisence of her as a young Jew in Ukraine, whose family is on occassion forced to hide from the murderous rampages of Russian Cossacks in search of 'entertainment'."},

The cackles are aplenty and relentless, with everyone (yes, everyone!) in the cast getting their memorable LOL moments. While I see it being talked about a lot as a horror-comedy, I feel the right way to refer to it is comedy-horror; situational humour precedes all else in the film. The horror aspect gains some strength in the final act, but the setup is kept aside for a potential sequel. But, for what it's worth, Jithu Madhavan's debut effort is splendid in seamlessly blending an eerie atmosphere with humour that arises from spontaneous reactions, subtle change of expressions on the actors' faces, and witty one-liners."},

Background music is apt. We all were glued to our seats from start to end. Our kids also liked the part where Kavin interacts with his son in multiple scenes. Thanks to prime video for bringing this movie to home screens. Best wishes to Kavin for taking a nice movie and expecting more such quality movies in future."},

What i didn't like is the performance of the actress.. It could have been done so much better which can make us cry for few scenes. But failed.. Overall watchable movie. Kavin and his friend 's acting was good.. Bgm are Ok.. Feel good movie.. Could have been a blockbuster with better performers... The small boy's acting was also average. Should have concentrated more in casting... This will be first good movie in kollywood in 2023..We expect certain scenes when will and how will it happen.

Along the way there, they stop at a restaurant where they meet an interesting stranger named \"Pratap\" (Hiten Kumar) who they invite to sit at the table with them. Not thinking too much of it, they then head back to their car and part ways with him. Strangely enough, not long after arriving at their summer home, they happen to see Pratap at the gate who tells them that his car broke down and he needs to make a phone call. Naturally, being the courteous people that they are, they invite him inside to use their phone. To their horror, once inside, he uses black magic to cast a hypnotic spell on their teenage daughter \"Aarya\" (Janki Bodiwala) and informs them that he does not intend to leave the house without her coming with him. And to show them that he means business, he not only compels Aarya to seriously injure their young son \"Ansh\" (Aaryan Sanghvi), but also threatens to have her kill each and every one of them if they don't do what he demands. Now, rather than reveal any more, I will just say that this was a rather dark horror film which took a really bizarre turn toward the end. Yet even though I would have preferred a different ending, the one depicted here is much more horrific and seems somewhat more appropriate. But that's just my opinion and I will leave it at that. Be that as it may, this turned out to be a pretty good horror film, and I have rated it accordingly. Above average."},

Surprisingly, it was a decent crowd with mainly couples. The beginning was o'k , the ending was pretty good but the middle was absolutely borrrring!!!! It will almost put you to sleep. There was no chemistry , no character development and not much going on. Unlike the first two , Mike had rapport with his dance partners , this one had nothing. The dance partners were too old to be a stripping act so that would not work, but they could have come up with something better. This will probably be the end of this one, as I'm assuming this is going to get a thumbs down - all the way around."},

They just manage to release some really good movies, unlike their neighbouring countries that rarely bring us decent movies. No overacting with the South-Koreans which is quite rare with Asian actors. Writer/director Kim Tae-joon had the good idea making a crime/thriller about our usage of our smartphones, something a lot of people are just addicted to. You could not have made this movie a couple decades ago, as everybody would have seen it as a sci-fi but nowadays it looks pretty realistic. Certainly the youth that feel the need and urge to share their complete life with the rest of the world, until they will encounter an evil person like in this movie. Good acting, good storytelling with a bit of mystery, and good cinematography, definitely worth a watch."},

You have images of someone playing video games and doing stuff on the phone. Then that's when the main lead female comes out. She works at her dads business. She later uses her phone and then someone calls her to say they found it and it's at a cellphone repair shop and that they would pick up the bill. That's the first red flag. The obvious one is when the repair person asks for the password. That's really exaggerated and false. You don't need a password to replace a screen or even repair the phone. I had my screen replaced and never was I asked for my password. Later on she trusts the stranger more than her friend. Then the police get involve and one of the cops realizes that it may be his son. Since the wife knew that he had worked in cellphone repair. He had a chance to stop him but didn't , which brings us to the end of the movie. The father of the girl almost dies because of the cop and then later the girl shoots the guy to death since the father didn't have the backbone to do it. It later cuts to a seen where they are taken in an ambulance for treatment, but nothing was ever told of what happened later making this a really lousy ending. It's okay to watch because you would only lose 2 hours of your time ."},

Well with this latest \"Magic Mike's Last Dance\" I decided to check it out because one of my favorite actresses Salma Hayek is on board for this one. Set in Miami after the pandemic male entertainer and dancer Mike(Tatum) has fallen on hard times as he finds himself out of work and broke tending bar in Miami. However fortunes changes when he meets Maxandra Mendoza(the beautiful and sexy as hell Salma Hayek) a wealthy and attractive socialite who's also going thru personal changes, yet she makes Mike an offer he can't refuse. The journey is off to London to a classic like theatre as Mike with the music and moves can entertain and start his life anew. Overall good story of connection and attachment, still it's a love tease look for some hot exotic, and steamy dance scenes early in the film between Mike and Max as you as the viewer will be refreshed and feel the love in the air. This movie moves along well as a sexy dance tease."},

It's boring more often than not and plays it way too safe. Women are more naked in a burlesque show than these men were. Why exactly is this rated R? Today's music videos are more R-rated than this. I would say the most entertaining scene was the lap dance Channing Tatum gives Salma Hayek but other than that most of the movie is just her whining about the show they're going to put on and when the show finally comes it's not nearly as exciting as it should be. I know plenty will say it but I'd rather this movie had been a Step Up movie and them just left Magic Mike at the sequel. Compared to the other two it was just an unfun ride. Also on a side note when she's going through the different types of men that \"women want\" a CEO that pays women more than men? I thought the goal was to be equal allegedly? And how about a man with a puppy! Men have dogs all the time how about a man that puts the seat down or does the dishes. Anyway unlike the other two I'll never see this one again."},

Making magic Mikes last dance more mature and thoughtful hasn't really worked the dancing and stripping is a lot tamer it's no where as sexy or as entertaining as the previous films in the franchise.mikes last dance scene was wow but even this isn't enough to save the entire film . Overall it's a slow burner that doesn't feel authentic to the original movie I think there were betters ways to have shown Mike had matured and no longer strips ,replaced the gyrating and air humping for modern expressive dance and ballet .

The backdrop works as a satire of technology-obsessed society, in which every aspect of one's life is controlled by that little gadget which seemingly never leaves the hand. The rest is a reworking of the usual psycho-thriller genre, with plenty of familiar tropes. It starts out fairly innocuous and with maybe only a mild case of stalking, before gradually moving into darker territory as the story goes on. It's no THE CHASER, but it's watchable in its own right although the ending is too drawn out.

I absolutely loved the first two Magic Mike movies. Both 10/10s. But this movie was something else... From the very beginning I was put off by the insanely out of place narration. Not only did it make no sense. But it had nothing to do with the plot or essence of the movie. People watch Magic Mike to watch Magic Mike dance and strip. Instead the audience was completely robbed of everything they came into the movie expecting. There were very few scenes of actual stripping and amongst those rare scenes, there was frequent cutting that was beyond irritating. The movie took itself way too seriously without presenting anything meaningful. There were many unnecessary and random scenes that made no sense in the context of the movie. ESPECIALLY the cat intermission scene. I don't even know what to say about it - I have no words. The play itself was absolutely atrocious. I felt like I was watching a scene from Glee. Overall I was shocked by the countless out of place aspects of the film. Narration, Unicorn, Intermission, Swan Guy, Shallow \"Love Story\", why is everyone British?, lack of good music. I really regret watching this. So if this saves anyone the hour and 52 minutes I lost of my life, I'm glad to be of service."},

He sets off to the local shop to replenish and encounters a gang of homophobic chavs. Maybe ill-advisedly, he responds to their taunts and when outside is followed and badly beaten. Not surprisingly, this experience turns the young man into a bit of a recluse. He struggles to come to terms with what has happened and this affects his relationships with flatmates \"Toby\" (John McCrea) and \"Molly\" (Antonio Clarke). His mindset changes, however, after a trip to a sauna re-introduces him to his protagonist \"Preston\" (George MacKay) who aside from being a bit of a thug, is clearly closeted too. The two hook up, it's raw and visceral - and his new mate drives off and leaves him afterwards! This, however, sows a seed in his mind and some You-tubing later leaves him with a plan to film and expose \"Preston\" to the very creatures with whom he exists. What he doesn't quite count on, indeed neither man (nor us) really, follows as the story evolves from one of violence and vengeance into one that might actually touch on something deeper. \"Jules\" learns to adapt to his nemesis's world of drugs, violence and hatred - even to turn it to his own advantage, and that elicits a response from his new found \"friend\" that is almost touching at times... Thing is though, can leopard's change their spots? NJS is superb here but for me it's MacKay who made me sit up and take notice. There is something distinctly authentic about his depiction of this screwed up bully and as the film progresses and the dynamic between the men changes, his is the character that I actually began to feel ever so slightly sorry for.

Yes, that is true, but holy the new episode makes up for it. The cgi animation completely blows every other anime out of the water. The camera controls and large scale shots were immaculate, and the comedy afterwards was great too. And some of you may say it's bad because there were no action scenes, but I think it would be weird to expect another fight right after the last season ended. So overall, this is a great movie, but it should have been edited together more seamlessly. I did find sitting through credits 2 times midway through the movie a bit weird."},

Maybe seeing them go through their recovery and training and idk just not 60 percent of stuff I can see on crunchy roll already. It's like someone just mashed the last three episodes of the entertainment district arc into one video. Multiple credits that you would see while streaming a show. It's basically a recap with an advance screening of the first episode of the sword smith arc. Better off waiting for the new season to come out. Honestly not worth the money to see in theaters at all."},

However, seeing it presented in a theatrical format was actually really good. The animation and sound design really benifit from being put up on the big screen. It felt epic. Now, I've never seen the anime myself and went to this on a whim because I've already seen everything else in theaters at the time. This made me want to watch the anime. I was invested by the time it ended. The first episode of the (I'm assuming from what I've read) 3rd season is a bit underwhelming as there are no fight sequences, just a bit of tying things up from the last season. It didn't really need to be a part of this and might have benifitted by stricly being a recap of the previous season. My only issue with this compilation film is the multiple opening and ending credit sequences. Those should have been edited out and the episodes should have been edited together for a more fluid experience. So, in that, I understand the issues fans of the series would have had with that in particular. Overall, even with all the blanks I had to fill in the story, I was entertained enough to give this a positive review and say that I thoroughly enjoyed it."},

The suspense is watching how two people cross almost impossible barriers ( mainly caused by our society's homophobia ) and become lovers. Yes there is revenge in this loving, but this too is fed by society and its prejudices. There are two horrific physical attacks both instigated by frustration as one of the lead characters cannot accept his homosexuality. A black man who is also a drag artist is beaten up and the man who beats him, and forgets that he has done this is a former imprisoned criminal, and astonishingly during the duration of what we see a love story develops between the attacker and the attacked. No more spoilers but the two leads are perfect in their roles and so is the direction perfect. I saw the film as a queer ' Romeo and Juliet ' where two people have their own Montagues and Capulets, and how these opposing sides are enemies as well as being friends. It is definitely not a sad gay/queer film and there is at the end a yellow hoodie birthday gift that signalled that their need, however perverse in the eyes of the politically correct, would continue for each other. A film of beauty and a brutal tenderness despite heteronormative values that neither of them deep down want to follow. A great, great film."},

It begins with a hate crime, it turns into a revenge film before finally becoming the most unusual and sad love stories I've ever seen. It's about love, hate, acceptance, violence, tolerance, revenge, regret and, for me at least, confusion on how I wanted this to end as well as to how it does conclude. I wasn't really confused by the ending, but I was confused about how I felt about it. It floored me. The story of a drag performer getting revenge on his attacker is as complex a relationship as you will ever find. There are a number of actors in this, but the two leads so tower over all else, I already can barely remember them. I've seen George MacKay in a lot of films since he was a youngster and I've never seen him give a bad performance in a career highlighted by the brilliant 1917 in which the camera only briefly ever leaves his shocked and awed face. His role here is much more multi-faceted depicting a violent, ugly character learning acceptance of others, kindness, being accepted, and love. On the other hand, I'd never seen Nathan Stewart-Jarrett in anything, but his role has many dimensions as well and they are both wonderful. This LGBTQ film is unlike any other that I have seen. It is also one of the best, dark and sad as it may be."},

It begins with two different storylines which connect together seamlessly. The aspect of it that it excels in the most is that it shows how groups of people who appear to be pushing in two different directions can both be genuinely searching for the same goals and the good life. The movie examines the pitfalls of nihilism and absolute relativism but also how being closed minded to possibilities and ideas can be limiting. All of these themes are displayed without the movie trying to force upon its audience any particular set of religious beliefs."},

Kevin is none too thrilled at the prospect of having moved yet again as Frank has made a habit of going for ill-advised business ventures that necessitate their moving from place to place. While exploring the attic Kevin encounters a ghost of a man in a bowling shirt with the name \"Ernest\" (David Harbour) stitched on the breast who tries in vain to scare Kevin who records the apparition on his phone. As Kevin tries to communicate with Ernest in the hopes of getting to know him better, the two strike up a friendship. However Kevin's brother and father soon find the video on his phone and posting the video on the internet turns Ernest into a social media sensation much to Kevin's annoyance.

The story follows a family of four who moves into a new house, only to find out that it's haunted by the ghost of a guy (David Harbour) who wears a bowling shirt with the name Ernest on it. The first to come into contact with him, is the younger sensitive son, Kevin (played by Jahi Di'Allo Winston), who feels all alone and can't connect with his family, especially his father (Anthony Mackie). When Kevin sees Ernest, he bonds with him and makes it his mission to find out his story and help him cross over to the other side, but naturally it's not that simple, as the family find themselves targeted by the CIA (Tig Notaro and Steve Coulter), who want to capture Ernest and do experiments on him. Kevin teams up with the girl next door (Isabella Russo) in order to uncover the mystery behind Ernest and help him out. Even though there are so many ghost stories, this one does offer something fun and new, first of all seeing David Harbour playing a ghost (with unattractive hair cut) and not being able to say any words, is truly impressive. The rest of the cast does good job all around (too bad Jennifer Coolidge had such a short time on screen though). I especially loved a moving scene between Kevin and his father, where he becomes honest and tells him that he's proud of him. Also the visuals and soundtrack are also great. The films discusses many topics such as family, social media and the power of friendship (even with a ghost)."},

This movie centres on a woman named bok soon, played by jean do yeon. She is pretty good in her role and comes off well as the innocent movie that is also hiding a secret, she is actually a hitwoman for hire. From the start of the movie we know what we arein far as this powerful assasin eleminates her first target. The cinemotogrpahy is reallt well done and the way the fighting is coreographed is done in a good way where you can follow the action as the camera does. Its pretty violent too and works well. Overall kill bok soon is another great netflix original with a good mix of action and a little bit of comedy in there too."},

I think this is the first movie where the wronged party (the fiancee) literally provides the so-called heroine with ALL of the ammunition to use against her. Who does that?! While this one has shades of My Best Friend's Wedding, the big difference is that you really don't get invested in any of the characters because none of them are likeable. I just didn't feel the love with any part of this triangle. It was all overly contrived. It's also extremely uncomfortable how the fiance has told EVERYBODY in town her business in the short 6 months she's dated this guy and they're all passing it around like party favors on the eve of the wedding. Every time we see the ex-girlfriend stalking the couple like chewed up, spit out karmic gum on a shoe while pretending to be a videographer, it makes less and less sense. If the groom didn't get rid of her, the bride-to-be should have made it clear that she was NOT welcomed. Note to anyone confused: You should NOT be at your ex's wedding as a single. That's not about insecurity, it's about the energy especially when she looks like a thirsty stripper in every scene. Even a couple of so-called emotional scenes can't save this one. And why was the lesbian hint thrown in?? Too much stuff in the soup without enough quality ingredients. On the bright side, it is a little bit better than Shotgun Wedding. Not by much though."},

I think it just started playing on Prime and Alison Brie pulled me in. All the acting is good here. The dialogue is more realistic than the usual rom-com, and I didn't need to suspend disbelief as much as I usually do in this genre. It really shouldn't even go in the rom com bucket but marketing didn't know how else to sell it. Forget the labels. Yes, there's a my-best-friend's-wedding vibe, but, in a moment of self awareness, this is even addressed in a joke. The characters are likable, even the slightly shady Sean. Ally and Cassidy have authentic exchanges as two women supposedly at odds, but finding a lot of commonality. I love a coming-to-mutual respect scene topped off with a celebratory streaking! I was so pleasantly surprised by this one, it makes me wonder, why the other low ratings? Sure, some of these plot points are familiar. Yes, trying to break up a wedding last minute is cringy, but we're living in a Fast n Furious franchise world here. I don't care if we can go watch cars fly... I'm watching brain cells fly right outta my head with those ones. Franco and Brie's movie is for fun and ultimately has a great message.

There are some cute moments. The premise is a little mean, but Brie's lovable personality makes it less so-or does it. The meanest part is how her boyfriend's current girlfriend is inadvertently collateral damage. Many of the lines and relationship are weak. It is low budget. It is predictable .

My message to them: don't. The outcome is inevitably a salad with everything in it, desperately trying to be original but falling apart in this gigantic effort to mix everything in. Unfortunately, Kill Bok-soon is no exception. First, the director has no idea what this movie wants to be: a dark movie? A comedy? A jaw-dropping action movie? A psychological drama? Second: if you want yo make a local John Wick movie, just do it. Don't pretend to be something else, patching it with endless, boring and nonsense mother-daughter dialogues. Third: choose your villain and stick to it. Who is it here? Chairman Cha? Director Cha? And finally, and probably because of all those mentioned before: it is soooo loooongggg.

This time, Ally, a reality show producer faces a career crisis and comes home to rural Washington to connect with her old flame Sean from a decade ago only to discover he's getting married to a younger woman Cassidy who is facing her own challenges in abandoning her burgeoning rock music career for marriage. Showing her signature spunk with comic aplomb as Ally, Alison Brie co-wrote the screenplay with her husband Dave Franco who directed. Despite some sharp jabs at reality TV at the outset, their plot follows a predictable path with the characters acting just as you'd expect in their respective predicaments. Jay Ellis is given little to do but act moony or confused as Sean. Kiersey Clemons fares better as Cassidy who recognizes her affinity with Ally. Julie Hagerty displays her trademark ditziness as Ally's sexually active mom, while a still recognizable Haley Joel Osment energetically plays a family friend who is an irritating pop culture geek."},

The plot is convoluted. Stephen Lauddem is a famous composer with writer's block who sleeps with Katrina, a shopworn tugboat captain with a sex addiction, and then writes a celebrated opera about their fast affair. Stephen is married to Patricia, a beautiful Manhattan therapist with OCD and a strange obsession with nuns. There's a parallel story of Patricia's son who is in love with the underaged daughter of the family maid whose husband is hellbent on breaking up the relationship. All the story strands come together but don't emotionally resonate nearly as much as they should. Miller seems more preoccupied with the characters' eccentricities. The star performances compensate. Peter Dinklage plays Stephen with jaundiced charm, while Anne Hathaway shows off a welcome edginess to Patricia. Marisa Tomei conveys a convincing lived-in approach to Katrina that helps ground the movie's somewhat flighty tone."},

The film alternates between being a survival thriller and a twisted exercise of the mind, exploring themes of isolation, anxiety, and the need for human connection. While the movie touches on these deeper themes, it also delves into the idea of art and its inseparable bond to the human will. Nemo's inherent urge to create and express is showcased as he sketches on shreds of paper or creates his own mural while trapped in the penthouse. The freedom of the New York City skyline, just beyond the panes of unbreakable glass, is a cruel tease, making art a soothing balm in his confined world. Dafoe's physical and psychological transformation is both harrowing and fascinating to watch. Though Nemo's character may be a tad too opaque, the audience is submerged into his experience, feeling the palpable sense of confinement and being cut off from the outside world."},

Anyone who has ever been falsely accused will find this a very disturbing movie. It is so well acted that it seems like a documentary, rather than fiction. This film and AMERICAN FICTION both show what horrible little prigs today's young people have been turned into. They are basically good and want to do the right thing, but they know in their heart of hearts that they are morally superior. This movie made me glad that I am not a teacher today. This is a rivetingly suspenseful movie that is quite harrowing at times. It asks some disturbing questions and doesn't provide easy answers.

We are not made privy to anything the film's protagonist Carla Nowak (Leonie Benesch) doesn't know, which really helps to feel what it might be like to be in her shoes. Carla is a young teacher, who is not only an excellent educator, but also a genuinely good person, really empathetic and with a great sense of right and wrong. There's theft happening at the teacher's lounge. Theft is, obviously, wrong. Frisking 7th graders looking for dubious evidence in a desperate attempt to find the thief - that's kind of wrong too. But the right seems to be ever more elusive. The perpetrator, when caught pretty much red handed, is so good at playing a victim, that the noble Carla finds herself questioning her sanity.

She does, potentially, identify someone going through her pockets and headmaster \"Böhm\" (Anne-Katrin Gummich) now tries to deal with a scenario that rapidly spirals out of control and reveals an increasing degree of toxicity for not just this teacher, but for relationships at all levels throughout the school - as well as a fairly counter-productive environment of red-tape. We are soon facing a stand-off situation that borders on the criminal with some surprisingly potent battle lines soon drawn both inside and outside of the teacher's lounge. I had credibility issues with what happens now. It's not that the drama isn't well acted and tautly directed, indeed the young Leonard Stettnisch's portrayal of her student-cum-antagonist \"Oskar\" is really effective. It is just that too much of what occurs struck me as preposterous. Any procedures in place to protect teachers and pupils seems to gave been chucked under the dramatic bus and the absence of police or qualified investigative authorities here just didn't ring true as we made our way to a denouement that I felt rather underwhelmed.

Directed by writer Aline Brosh McKenna, who has written many popular romantic comedies, including \"27 Dresses\" and \"The Devil Wears Prada,\" the film is a typical feel-good movie that is good for a lazy day on Netflix. Reese Witherspoon and Ashton Kutcher star as Debbie and Peter, who have been best friends for 20 years. They are opposites, with different lifestyles and personalities, and the movie follows their journey as they switch homes for a week. While the two lead actors are good-looking and charismatic, the film is let down by its bland script and lack of depth. The supporting characters, including Tig Notaro and Zoe Chao, are more interesting, but overall the movie is predictable and lacks any real twists or surprises."},

For a film that pretentiously begins in 2003 and ends in 2023, there's very little actual romance or comedy here that grabs your sustained attention. The film just plods along in a familiar \"can best friends turn lovers?\" setup, the payoff of which is so minuscule and very 2003-like. Sure, it's not a film you'd ditch half-way, yet it has nothing that warrants a revisit - as is the case with most Netflix \"originals.\" Also, a film like this would have actually benefited from having Kutcher and Witherspoon in the same space (to hell with those split-screens) a lot longer than 5 minutes tops.

It is refreshing to see romance movie that two main characters do not spend much time together physically, but audience can sense their friendship has been strong partly because they have been friends to us millennial for a long time as well.

Sadly, now we have reached a nadir for this charismatic and unorthodox character. The story is so ridiculously far-fetched that it reminded me of something Mark Gatiss might have written for \"Sherlock\" before he watched \"No Time To Die\" (2021) and thought - nah! It all starts when youngster \"Callum\" is dragged away from his night-time cleaning job by a mysterious phone call. Next thing we know, \"Luther\" (Idris Elba) is at a crime scene with no sign of the boy but with a victim in her car that has been missing for ages. Enter the completely un-menacing \"Robey\" (Andy Serkis) and pretty soon our favourite policeman is incarcerated for a career of systematic rule-bending/breaking and this rather evil monster now proceeds to prove that evil can prevail - and on a fairly spectacular scale. This story is, frankly, preposterous and as the film lumbers along for over two ours I really struggled to remain engaged as it moved from suicide scenarios to far more brutal killings - but what, exactly, is motivating this man is anyone's guess. He appears to have acquired control over a vast network of technology and people to effect his dastardly plan but none of that even vaguely rings plausible. The last twenty minutes are just plain silly and overall, the writing is all rather poor: \"They'll kill you John\" - \"I can live with that!\" - not an hint of irony there, neither. This is a pretty shameless attempt to capitalise on a strong character made memorable by a charismatic actor and a series of solid stories. This film has thrown all of those under the snowplough."},

Of course the cast helps with the likes of the ultra talented duo of Andy Serkis and Idris Elba who's cat and mouse chase is pure entertainment. The story while it may remind me personally of 90s throwback thrillers is still updated for a time where cyber crime is a real threat and adds a great aspect. The action is also on full throttle in this as well which is nice to see. Overall the intensity of this film belongs in a theater but even so I do think it's a cut above for Netflix original movies these days. Very surprising film."},

I'm not complaining about the constant suspense and thrills, but another 15-20 mins added would've done this film justice, and that's coming from someone who gets impatient for anything longer than a 90 min runtime. Aside from some plot and technical issues, and having to overlook some ridiculousness of overly ambitious and unrealistic scenes, the story flowed really well, and was constant edge of your seat entertainment.

In particular, newcomer Briana Middleton is a stunning unknown quantity in her Janus-faced transmutations; Sebastian Stan burnishes his rough edges with enough charisma to make the story credible, but the real deal is, irrefragably, Moore's delectable Madeleine, an acquisitive cougar with a kleptomaniac urge, who exudes an exquisite concoction of monstrosity and elegance, deception and self-disclosure. Scarcely could an actress age so gracefully and alluringly into her 60s, Moore is a touchstone of defying ageism and advocating the irrelevance between a woman's beauty and her age, SHARPER is another indicator that perhaps the best is yet to come for this beloved auburn goddess."},

There's a bit of a Tarantino influence in that regard but it's fine. Moore is always an interesting actress and she has a good role here. The others do ok. A few dumb, eye-rolling twists don't get in the way of an overall good con movie. A few moments are predictable but I guess thieves rely heavily on unrealistic people reactions to pull off a con. I'd like to see what happens in the aftermath. Apple+ doesn't have that many movies so if you're looking for a twisty drama, this one will do fine."},

Perhaps I'm not as well-versed in con movies as some other reviewers here, but I got so involved in the story that I honestly didn't see the final twist coming, and was very satisfied with how the movie ended. Finally, I felt the movie was very well acted, and I thought Julianne Moore did a particularly good job in her role. This movie is definitely worth a watch."},

This non-linear approach works well to maintain intrigue, making it feel fresh and unpredictable-at least for the first half of the movie."},

This film is of course competently made, looks good and is not horrible but is completely uninspired and like pretty much everything out of the MCE factory since Endgame it's totally forgettable. The reason that the MCU was so successful is that the films had characters we cared about. Stakes were there, of course they were lightoments but there were heroes to root for and some pretty good villains. We cared about what was on the screen. I didn't care at all about what I saw in Quantumania. Not that every film from Iron Man to Endgame was great but they were mostly at least better than average. The two previous Ant-Man films were among the weakest but were still more memorable than this one. The acting in Quantumania is fine but but again no one to really care about. Even Paul Rudd who is usually very engaging seemed just flat and disinterested here. He seems to be phoning it in.

The entire story was cliched and predictable, and there was more CGI than there was any type of interesting story, let alone one with any substance.

The created living entities of the quantum universe are more anthropomorphic (human-based) perhaps to be more relatable to children does not reflect the diversity or original forms of life or new-life that would really make this film stellar. As even as special as the set designs and special effects make for a gorgeous setting, there is still room for more crisp, detailed and immersive design work. Some backgrounds end up being mere basic animation projections that do not come up to the level expected of contemporary Marvel productions.

Doubling down on the sci-fi elements of the MCU. Overall the humor was like the rest of the previous movies. The cast was all stellar. Doesn't really dive that deep into Kang's story, but what we did get was sufficient. Johnathan Majors portrayal was excellent, just wish he had more substance to work with. The visual effects were definitely spotty. Blue screen overload, wish they took more time blending in the effects with with actors. This leads into Modok, as a concept. I didn't mind his backstop changing, just wish they went more practical with his design. Overall Quantumania was a pretty fun movie, but for setting the tone of \"PHASE 5\", Marvel will definitely need to step up their storytelling, and start getting more into detail with these characters, and concepts."},

Thanos and his Infinity War are now part of the past in a timeline that has been upended by the discovery of the multiverse. The hype surrounding Ant-Man and the Wasp 2(?) seemed impossible to meet. The same weight was put on the Multiverse of Madness which cracked under the pressure of expectation. Unfortunately, QuantumMania suffers the same fate. Kang is intimidating, powerful and compelling but has been muzzled and restrained by a screenplay that lacks courage and risk when it mattered. Majors is fantastic as the character and I can't wait to see him develop this character and other variants further. However, I can't help but see a missed opportunity here to plant Kang like a unavoidable tree in the multiverse saga. It feels like Marvel prefers to put all their eggs in the basket of Loki season 2 rather than a feature film."},

The characters were one-dimensional, the actors did a lot of scenery chewing without generating much interest in the story, the script was facile and superficial, the camera work was typical of low-budget productions with lots of protracted jerky hand-held shots. Ultimately, I found it difficult to empathize with any of the characters (I could never get past the thought that I was watching actors), and eventually I lost interest in the outcome altogether. Which is a shame actually, because there is a fascinating story buried in this misfire. Better attention to the script and casting, and better production values, might have helped. But I think this is one instance where a well-made documentary, with interviews, archival footage, etc. Might be a better way to tell the story."},

He, together with his boss Mike (Jay Baruchel), has been working with a small team of geeks to develop a mobile word processor that can send messages by text and email. It's funding they lack and it's during a fairly flawed presentation that they encounter \"Jim\" (Glenn Howerton), a savvy operator who knows just enough about the business to get them that elusive big deal. Thing is, they don't think they have the processing capacity to service this ever increasing share of the market even if their new pal is generating eye-watering business opportunities. A 46% market share of what became the exponentially burgeoning smartphone market offered them real potential to dominate for years - but history tells us just what did happen. This film benefits from not really having a big star at the helm. The three men juggle the pressures, successes and failures delivering a solid and at times quite funny story of the rise and falls of a company that, when faced with difficulties, resorted to an emergency movie night! It doesn't shy away from depicting some of the sharper practices at play in this supremely competitive business, but it delivers in a far less aggressive fashion. Maybe it's a Canadian thing, but I found myself actually wanting them to succeed (even if I actually ended up loathing my own \"Crackberry\"). So many of these true stories are based on characters seeking easy money - this is based on a pair of guys who actually made something; and something that set a benchmark for kit we all use across the world without a second thought nowadays. Enjoyable to watch and worth two hours of your time."},

The central performances (Jay Baruchel & Glenn Howerton) are fantastic, and both manage to captivate us with their distinct mannerisms and quirks. The story itself is very compellingly told, with details covered from multiple angles, including business, tech, marketing, employee relations, and more. There's no question that Hollywood loves discussing corporate wins and losses (well, mostly wins) and BlackBerry is certainly among the finest I've seen. Howerton (playing Jim Balsillie) is at his best when he loses his cool, throwing temper tantrums at almost everyone, including contemporaries, executives, and even private jet pilots. The rise and fall of BlackBerry was always going to be an exciting story, and director Matt Johnson does an excellent job with the material in hand."},

The former is a recovering drug addict whose has been sponsored by the latter for three years. Sadly, though, the older man has become terminally ill and so has sought the assistance of a doctor \"Maria\" (Maureen Beattie) to bring things to a peaceable end. \"Leon\" is very fond of his curmudgeonly old charge and so goes round on his day off only to find the pair implementing his exit plan. Determined not to lose his mentor, the three now embark of a brief tour of the old haunts in the hope that this might re-energise his spirits and maybe, just maybe, change the old man's mind. Despite the serious undercurrents of the film, there is a certain degree of joyousness to this story. Ward is on great form as his clear affection for \"Iver\" manifests itself as much as a dependency for him as it is love. Love, it is, too. Not a cheesy, sentimental one - but one borne out of respect and appreciation and one that these two men characterise really quite well. Beattie is also rather effective at providing the odd bit of relief from the fairly constant pace of a mini-adventure that is peppered with black humour and some ancient Norse prose (the older man is fascinated by Viking mythology). Ultimately, I think this is a film about dignity and choice - and some will like it and some will not. In any case, it's poignant and entertaining.
