There are flashes of potential in the premise and a few moments that hint at what the film could have been, but they're buried under clumsy pacing, awkward staging, and baffling creative choices. It's especially frustrating given the quality of the cast, who clearly have the talent to deliver something far better than what ends up on screen."},

The performances - especially from Damon and Affleck - are the biggest reason to sit through it; they inject texture into otherwise familiar genre scaffolding. As a thriller, it does enough to hold attention, but it rarely transcends its ingredients. The script's reliance on cliché and uneven character work keep it from being sharp. I genuinely think it's one of the better Netflix crime originals of recent years in terms of craft, yet obviously it doesn't meaningfully remake the genre or leave a distinct imprint. In raw terms: a solid genre fare with good acting, middling narrative ambition, and scattered execution, decent to watch once, forgettable in the long run."},

Overall not a bad movie, but also not a memorable one either.

Chemistry and acting skills of Damon and Affleck carry the movie giving it more appeal than it otherwise would have."},

Not the strongest script. Affleck and Damon perform well as usual, but the film itself is not among the best they have appeared in.

Damon hints at a damaged, conflicted man whose inner life the script never bothers to explore, while Affleck's swagger suggests a volatile dynamic that never truly materializes. Instead of letting their relationship drive the tension, the film leans on a predictable twist and a formulaic structure that keeps everything safely on the surface. Even the action, which should be the backbone of a movie like this, feels tame and forgettable. It all goes down easily enough, but scene after scene you can feel the more ambitious, more engaging version of this story slipping away."},

Plenty of viewers embraced its ambition and found it a gripping, atmospheric return to the Rage-infected world, but others were far less convinced. For some, the film's bleak mood felt oppressive, its runtime indulgent and its somewhat restrained approach to gore a disappointing departure from the series' feral energy."},

Last year's journey into a quarantined Britain, penned by Alex Garland, offered unnerving scares, disgusting violence and thoughtful storytelling. Carried by stellar performances, 28 Years Later brought new life to this twist on the \"Undead\" genre. The final scene of that film however, gave it's sequel a steep hill to climb. Could The Bone Temple, solidify that bold, tonal shift of an ending, into a satisfying chapter of the Rage Virus story? Admittedly, I was a bit worried. I chose to set aside my personal wishes for this story and cast aside all expectations. Thankfully, I was rewarded with a courageous, insane and frankly, unhinged film."},

This one involving cults, religion and philosophical elements added in with meaner, weirder and bolder ideas that keep things fresh. Danny Boyle's flair may not be present or the original music composers, but Nia DaCosta delivers her own flavour and take of a nicely shot and clean approach to the franchise's look and feel. It's also a much smaller scale movie than the previous ones, and that makes it way more focused and in my opinion far better paced and handled in most regards."},

The fourth installment of the 28 series picks up a few days after the events of the third and delivers brutality and excellent acting. It follows Spike as he joins the cult group where everyone is named Jimmy, despite having no choice. We also learn more about Ralph Fiennes' character, Dr. Kelson, and how he and Samson are trying to find a cure for the virus. Later in the film, Spike's group and Dr. Kelson's group meet, and all I can say is: Iron Maiden. I won't say any more. The film is really good; I highly recommend it."},

When I first watched the official trailer of the sequel, I liked it and I had high expectations about it, since I enjoyed the previous movie so much. Eventually, I went to the movies to watch it and I have to say that I'm kinda disappointed. I'm not saying that it was an awful movie, it's just that I had higher expectations about this one. When I first read the movie synopsis, I thought it was gonna be very interesting and kinda mysterious. Regarding the storyline, I have to say that it wasn't as well-written as I would like, it wasn't well-explained and it didn't felt like a zombie horror movie. Actually, the entire vibe of this movie was the exact opposite of the previous movie and I'm not saying that as a good thing. I mean, it wasn't as scary as the previous movie was, it wasn't as intense as the previous movie was and as I've said before, it didn't felt like a zombie horror movie. Just imagine that the screentime of the zombies was about 20 minutes, I'm not kidding. I have to admit, the gore level was the same as before, but there weren't as many kills as the 2025 movie had. Also, regarding the scariness, I have to say that it was kinda scary and there were some jumpscares, but it wasn't as insane and as shocking as the previous movie was. Moreover, I have to confess that I didn't enjoy the cinematography of the movie and I think the soundtrack/score didn't match the vibe of the movie. Anyway, I really hope the 3rd movie will be better than this one and it will have a similar vibe to 28 Years Later. Overall, \"28 Years Later: The Bone Temple\" was an average movie that I'm not sure if I would consider it a zombie horror movie because of the lack of zombies, furthermore the vibe of this movie was completely different than the previous movies. In conclusion, I'm not saying that it was a terrible movie and I would probably recommend it to my friends, it's just that it wasn't exactly what I was hoping for."},

It's the 28 Days Later franchise by way of \"Lord of the Flies\" and \"A Clockwork Orange.\""},

Not a great opening, very uneven compared to the rest. The film as a whole gets a lot better the longer you stick with it. The acting is the main reason my score is so high. Leo is great in this and so is Sean Penn. With all the nominations for benicio I thought he was gonna have a bigger performance but he's relegated to a significant side character. The action is good and the cinematography looks great. The dialogue is interesting. I just don't think its as great as everybody says it is. I had a good time for the most part. Its a little long but after that beginning the pace moves a lot smoother. There's not much explanation. Like we are told all of these things but are not told why to think this way or given reasons why we should think said way. Its a straight forward plot and I see why people like it so much. I think its a movie for the times and that's the reasons for the high scores but in the future years from now I don't think it will age as well as other films being released currently. I just think its a really good film I don't understand the glowing reviews calling it a masterpiece or winning a significant number of awards compared to other current greats. The character development is pretty thin. We are told these people are this and these people are that..not exactly sure what the message is supposed to be at the end of the day. Are they good guys? Are they bad guys? Morally grey? Its basically a story about a group of people trying to start a revolution. I like the story but don't try to think about it too much as you watch it just consume. Its heavily political so you'll likely love this or hate it. I'm leaning towards really liking it a lot I just think its overrated."},

It couldnt seem.to make its mind up what it wanted to be, and many long scenes were pointless. The action wasnt anywhere near as insane as people say. The chase was good, but Bullett still has the best car chase of all time! It was a mixed bag. Often silly comedic at odd times, which wasnt very funny either. I felt like it has four or five writers all pulling it in different directions of action, thriller, dark humour, and not that great at any of it.

But okay jokes aside, what's missing the most is a deeper dive into the characters and their relationships, who they are and why they do the things they do, but everything remains kind of surface level, unfinished, which results in me simply not caring about these characters. The action is nowhere near as crazy as they want you to think and the music, although great, is a bit too distracting at times. I'll conclude this review because I have nothing to say except that it's a perfectly solid movie but pls don't expect a masterpiece just because a big director's name is attached to it."},

It's watchable and even good, but it would benefit from some serious editing as the last half really begins to drag. Pro Tip: The big chase scene in a feature film shouldn't drag! Over-the-top characters are so plentiful that it's almost a relief when one isn't (I would have loved to have seen more of Benicio Del Toro's sensei!). I'm not sure how this can be called PTA's masterpiece when it really doesn't stand up to films like There Will Be Blood, Phantom Thread, and Magnolia). Those films, too, have plenty of over-the-top characters, but their stories are just more compelling."},

None other than George Bernard Shaw wrote a short play called \"The Dark Lady of the Sonnets.\" I remember seeing William Gibson's play, A CRY OF PLAYERS, in the late 1960s with Anne Bancroft and Frank Langella as \"Will\" and \"Anne.\" I read Anthony Burgess's novel, NOTHING LIKE THE SUN, about Shakespeare's alleged affair with the \"dark lady of the sonnets\" (who was an African in his version) a couple of years later. At the end of the 20th Century came Robert Nye's novel, THE LATE MR. SHAKESPEARE, about a homosexual actor in Shakespeare's troupe who played women's roles. In 1998 came Tom Stoppard's clever screenplay for the Oscar-winning film, SHAKESPEARE IN LOVE. I'm sure that there have been many others. The latest entry into the field is HAMNET, a best-selling novel (I have not read it) about the death of Shakespeare's young son, which has now been made into a movie. It is the weakest of the bunch."},

Boy was I wrong! HAMNET is actually the new movie directed by Academy Award winner Chloé Zhao. It is adapted from the 2020 historical fiction of the same name written by Maggie O'Farell, who cowrote the film with Zhao. It tells a story of William Shakespeare (Paul Mescal) and what could have been his inspiration to create one of the most popular plays in the history of the Globe, Hamlet. He quickly falls in love with Agnes (Jessie Buckley), who like Will, sees things differently. As Will sees things through his words on the page, Agnes sees things through nature, both of them outcasts of society. When tragedy strikes their family, both deal with their grief in different ways. This movie has moments that are hard to watch, but it's only because the acting doesn't feel like a performance. Utilizing close-up shots, it feels like I was in the room. Not only is Buckley going to get an award, I believe 12-year-old Jacobi Jupe as the titular character deserves something. It's a very clever bit of casting having his older brother Noah Jupe in this as well. There were a couple of shots that left me breathless. I don't want to say too much more about this, but I will say that art can be an opportunity for healing, and the movie has a way of depicting the spiritual power of art as a means of processing trauma. It also has an amazing score, using a rendition of the song On the Nature of Daylight. There are a few critics that have said this movie just never clicked for them emotionally. I've tried wrapping my head around that, to no avail. Overall, HAMNET is an extremely beautiful tragedy, an emotional masterpiece that might not click with you. Remember, keep your heart open, and bring tissues."},

The film follows the life of a regular family in a past era, focusing on their relationships and how they deal with life's challenges. It's about love, loss, and family bonds, but it doesn't hit you over the head with drama. Things unfold slowly and quietly - small gestures, looks, and silences speak just as much as words. The English countryside almost feels alive, quietly watching over the family, and the story shows that human emotions - grief, care, hope - are timeless, even across centuries."},

Or I wish it had done something a little unexpected. If you know the premise here, and have seen a Chloe Zhao movie before, and have seen a handful of Jesse Buckley and Paul Mescal performances before, close your eyes for two hours, and picture what Hamnet will look and sound like, and imagine the most generic structure and sequence of events you can for a period drama about love, family, and grief, and you will likely picture something close to what Hamnet is. You could watch this movie in your head, almost, without having seen the movie. There didn't need to be surprises here, necessarily, but I don't know. I just had this feeling like I've seen this film before, even if I haven't.

Mescal's Shakespeare doesn't suggest a man with a great interest in the theater or writing. In fact he's rather dull. We are told things about life in Stratford but don't always see them. The direction is uneven. It seems to lose focus at times. What am I supposed to be noticing here. Scenes containing two live birth go on and on. Some scenes sag. The print I saw in a theater was not very sharp. Why does Ann (Agnes) laugh at the end. The writing gets very pedestrian at times. Some scenes plod along. Tighter editing would have helped. Also tighter continuity. The premise here to explain Hamlet is potentially intriguing but this telling doesn't do it justice. It's not terrible but it's not very good either."},

Again, the finale involves the same characters battling it out in the same circumstances with a frustrating lack of resolution. The first two acts introduced some more darkness and stronger emotional beats than either of the first two movies, and the addition of the Ash people was an interesting take to finally see the bad side of Navi.

Emotional depth and a deep connection to the characters is why we fell in love with Avatar. In Fire and Ash, character motivations seem to be scattered all over the place. The story concentrates primarily around Spider, and his desire to fit in with the rest of the Na'vi. This narrative often times felt weak and struggled to drive the film forward, hitting a wall and slowly disengaging us from the film. I thought James Cameron directed fairly well, giving us great action scenes, while the visuals and sound were also a positive. Ultimately, this film fell short of expectations and leaves you with a mixture of disappointment and frustration."},

It feels like the writers no longer understand the true essence of the Yautja. In the original film, it wasn't just a mindless killer - it was a calculating hunter. Remember how it used its toxic dart to paralyze its prey before firing the plasma caster? Its weapon wasn't just for destruction; it could adjust its power and precision. That level of detail made the Yautja terrifying - a cold, silent, methodical predator who hunted one victim at a time, unseen, and only revealed itself when absolutely necessary or when its cloaking device was damaged."},

The tension, the grit, the primal fear that made the originals unforgettable, none of it survives here. Instead, we get glossy CGI fireworks, hollow lore dumps, and characters who wander through the story like they're immune to common sense. The Predator, once a terrifying apex hunter, now feels about as threatening as a malfunctioning parade float. Disney's influence hangs over the whole thing: every bold idea sanded down, every bit of personality replaced with something safe, sanitised, and painfully market-tested. As someone who grew up with these films, watching this felt strangely heartbreaking like coming home expecting something familiar and comforting, only to find it replaced with Snow White wearing a Predator mask. It left me with a genuine ache, almost like homesickness for a franchise that used to respect its own identity. And honestly, when will Disney learn that stripping away what made the original work special doesn't help anybody fans, newcomers, or the story itself?"},

I was reminded of how I felt when I had seen Star Wars: The Phantom Menace and trying to contemplate whether or not I liked it being a huge Star Wars fan. Predator: Badlands is like that movie in that it is another example of when a franchise just tries to get too cutesie and add humor to something that is not known for such. I was disappointed when I saw that this was PG-13 and not R. I wasn't disappointed with the movie as a whole but only in seeing that it lacked the bloody, gritty, testosterone-fueled feel of P1, P2 and Predators. I liked that the Weylan-Yutani storyline was included. Badlands is good if you want to take your kid to a lighter and more Disneyfied version of Predator before they're old enough to watch the original."},

Well if Pray was Star Wars, Badlands is Episode II: Attack of the Clones. They tried to inject a lot of humour into this movie which just didn't work for me, and I didn't feel it should have had a place in this movie. I found some of it just ridiculous. The story is actually very good and could have been epic in the same way Prey was. Prey is an incredible movie in so many ways and I was expecting Badlands to be the same, sadly, for me it wasn't. There are good elements in this film such as gaining some insight into the Predators home world and culture. I also though Elle Fanning was fantastic in this movie. If Badlands had taken itself more seriously I would have liked it a whole lot more. I don't actually think the fault lays with Dan Trachtenberg This is a 12A in the UK and I'm pretty sure Disney were trying to make it appeal to children. So once again Disney take something wonderful and completely destroy it. I'd love to see Dan Trachtenberg original script and not the Disneyfied version."},

The pacing of the movie is fantastic. Right from the beginning you get some lovely Yautja lore and breathtaking action. The story is simple and it does a good job of getting you from point A to B with plenty of fun surprises along the way. The action is a standout and I wouldn't be dismayed by the PG-13 rating because the kills are still awesome. The only difference is nothing red spills out, the gore is green, blue, white and lots of alien guts. The creature design is also a standout throughout the movie as well. Without saying much more I've been a Predator fan since the Arnie original. Anything Predator and I'll buy a ticket, even if it's as terrible as Predator 2018 or AvP Requiem. Predator Badlands is an extremely entertaining blockbuster from start to finish. Full of excellent action sequences, pathos and beautiful vfx. Definitely go see this in the theatre's if you're a fan, even if you have any trepidation regarding the creative decisions. I still think many Predator fans will find something to enjoy in Predator Badlands. Highly recommended."},

There's a strong sense of immaturity watching this film, the Disneyfication of Predator franchise, there's no denying that. We have the classic Disney theme of friends on an adventure, with cute xeno-species and plenty of morale-preaching and for-exposition-only dialogue you'd think a Predator would put an end to with a well aimed shot from a shoulder-mounted plasma cannon. There's even a couple of shots copying (or was it stealing?) from the Fellowship of the Ring, with the fellowship advancing along a mountain ridge path (you'll know it when you see it)."},

Smooth movements, a colorful design, and plenty of character in the motions, Zootopia 2 is a gorgeous display of what is possible with their resources, giving the audience plenty to look, gawk, and enjoy as the multi-biome city returns once more to the big screens. Within this environmental playground is an adventure that feels a bit bigger and more explored than the previous film's montage did. We dive into a few more secrets and environmental factors, playing around with the fauna that is indigenous to them, adapting to the needs as the wild adventure unsheathes its claws. It goes more down the traditional Disney route to teach lessons, but not be so in your face like the first film, which opens up a bit more of an escape from the real world. And helping to keep things fun is comedy that is present in so many forms that it's hard not to find some style to have you cracking up in the theater. Kids are going to become infatuated with a lot of the silliness invoked, and many of the parents will probably get pulled into the fervor with them and making many Instagram/TikTok videos to mimic them. My favorite part had to be the references. Like Wish, Zootopia 2 is ready to poke fun at Disney's work, and you'll find references abound within the two hours as another collective \"cameo\" menagerie is integrated into the movie. Mostly comedic, sometimes emotional, these references serve as another angle to enjoy the film for a geek like me. All of this is done at a decent pace, an adventure to follow in a manner that doesn't feel slow, and relatively keeps things in check to not be extremely fast you have no content."},

Iconic scenes, like the mentioned one from the first movie, are missing and the humour is also just hectic and plain unfunny, to me - and compared to the humour of the first movie.

I have seen over 180 screenings in the theatre this year, this is easily one of the best of 2025. I wouldn't call myself a Neil Diamond fan, but enjoyed some of the greatest hits over the years. You do not need to be a fan to enjoy this film. This is the only film this year that hit my heart like this, bringing happy tears, sad tears... this was a tearjerker, bring the tissues. Kate Hudson should win best actress of the year. Great chemistry between the leads. The supporting cast is amazing as well. Great music, great drama, with several unexpected twists.

As Milwaukee Neil devotee Mike, Hugh Jackman trades his Logan lamb chops for that amazing Neil hairdo you usually only see on Mexican detention officers to sing Diamond's hits with a true showman's devotion; his maniacal, Wolvie-like intensity just makes one wish that proposed 'Klaus Kinski as Wayne Newton' biopic had gotten off the ground.

Just as changing a single note in an orchestration can shift the entire mood of a piece, this film captures life's shifting seasons through bittersweet moments and unanswered questions. Told through the lens of a professional musician, the film delivers a vital message: if you aren't \"enough\" for yourself, music will never be enough to fill the void. Kate Hudson and Hugh Jackman deliver elevated performances that ground the film's artistic style. While many musical biographies feel repetitive, this is a rare entry in the genre. It is a cautionary tale that remains planted in solid values, expertly balancing emotional weight with accessibility. It never becomes overly sentimental, nor does it get so lost in its period setting that it alienates a modern audience."},

It's hard to use the word 'enjoy' given the context and the outcome of this classical piece but it definitely touched me as well as kept me tense and all ears. Both Andrews (Garfield and Scott) are fantastic: each of their words, sounds they uttered was permeated with their character's living essence whereas - it was most likely decided that way - Cynthia Erivo as Julia remained more distant and sober, which was probably a good balance. They got carried away, in my opinion, with the number of layers of sound audible at the same time (telescreens speaking, rattlings, street noises, yelling and shouting, etc.); it could have been a bit cleaner and clearer by the rule \"less is more\" but probably this exaggeration was part of the programme. But all in all, great work, highly recommended, especially if you're a fan of either of the Andrews or/and into noticing how at this very moment, 40 years after 1984, - at least some parts of - the world are falling thick and fast into this horrifying i-love-big-brother reality."},

Having said that, this latest effort seems to be moving a lot of people quite a lot, and most who see it seem to think it's a masterpiece. Perhaps my slight disconnect with it is more due to my own expectations than any actual flaws of the feature, but I do feel like the flick struggles to come together with a cohesive point or message and ultimately leaves me a little cold. It's still a really well-made and well-performed picture that's satisfyingly subtly meta and generally well-observed, with tangible relationships and several really poignant musings on life and the ways in which we navigate through it. Intermittently funny and equally as often moving, the movie is slightly too long but always at least somewhat compelling. The main dynamic at its core is a father-daughter scenario, but the narrative's most emotionally affecting relationship to me is its sister bond. The experience is more than capable of focusing on multiple relationships, and this complexity is a marker of its general nuance and gentle profundity, but I can't help but feel like it isn't quite sure who it wants its main character to be and it doesn't spend enough time with the daughter of its father-daughter rapport for its emotional payoff to hit as hard as it's clearly intended to. Despite my hesitations with some of it, this is a really solid effort all around. It's moving, it's funny, it's well-crafted and expertly performed. Its emotional effect is relatively minor for me personally, but it's an engaging and often beautiful affair that will surely mean a lot to a lot of people. It's good."},

The film focuses on two of the generations: father and two daughters living their life in modern Norway and dealing with the emotional baggage from their past in very different ways. The film honestly opens the door for us into this family house so that we see things the way they are, no character is judged or mocked here. Yet, the storytelling itself has its own twists, therefore we can get the pieces together towards the end, which makes this film even more wholesome and delicate.

The father is a film director, absorbed with a new idea for a film, one which seems to be a dramatic representation of a crucial incident in his earlier life. One daughter has acted in the past, the other is currently an actor, performing in a Chekhov play. The father introduces his daughters to a young American actor, played by Elle Fanning, whom he intends to have as the key actor in his new film, representing, it seems, one of his daughters. She may or may not be the father's latest partner. The daughters want to keep their distance both from their father and any involvement in their father's film.

Director Joachim Trier and screenwriter Eskil Vogt bring a similar dynamic by introducing life's complications into a richly textured story of two sisters, Nora and Agnes, dealing with the return of their estranged father, Gustav Borg, a renowned filmmaker who decides after a long break, to make a film ostensibly about his mother but really about the daughters. He wants Nora, an accomplished stage actress, to star, but upon her immediate refusal, he casts Rachel Kemp, a popular American actress instead. Meanwhile, Agnes, who is married with a young son and decidedly not in the business, takes tentative steps to get closer with him but faces her own struggles with his emotional interference. As the film within the film develops, the lines between life and art get blurrier and blurrier, and Trier even borrows an appropriate allusion to Bergman's \"Persona\". There are also welcome, unexpected laughs along the way as well. As Borg, Stellan Skarsgård strikes the right balance between megalomania bluster and vulnerability. The three actresses are all superb. Renate Reinsve gives an incisive portrait of an actress caught in a maelstrom of conflicting emotions, while Inga Ibsdotter Lilleaas brings credible warmth with subtle moments of rancor to the less showy role of Agnes. The biggest surprise is Elle Fanning who doesn't play Rachel as commercial and vacuous but rather as conscientious and conflicted. The technical elements are aces, in particular, Kasper Tuxen's cinematography, Olivier Bugge Coutté's fluid film editing, and Jørgen Stangebye Larsen's pristine production design."},

The chimp is a motion capture of Miguel Torres Umba ala Andy Serkis from LOTR. Anyway, the movie has a surfeit of gore for horror fans and there is truly suspenseful denouncement where Kotsur's deafness plays a role. There are of course some actions by the characters that defy common sense as well actions by the chimp that don't seem possible - but that is what \"artistic license\" is all about.

I feel like first off the movie is really intense at times and Ben is quite intimidating at times throughout the movie and the film really has some nice cinematography which elevates the scares in this film here. Obviously the movie is at its best when Ben is hunting down our characters and just being an absolute menace but the film gets quite messy with a really weird storyline and there's lots of plot holes which just don't get resolved and it really left me scratching my head while watching the film. Most of the characters are pretty forgettable as well for the most part and they make quite literally the stupidest choices ever. Lucy played by Johnny Sequoyah is quite easily like the only character who's actually interesting and I actually really liked her character in this film and some of the family dynamics help the film but some of these moments felt pointless. I'll also give the film some credit because I really loved the soundtrack in this film and it was really eerie at moments which I just absolutely loved so honestly shoutout Adrian Johnston for the soundtrack because I loved what they did here. The movie also has some decent horror throughout the move and some moments felt really cheap but those other moments felt really scary and terrifying at times. I also really liked the practical effects here and they looked absolutely amazing with all of the kills throughout the movie as well. Overall this movie isn't bad but it's a decent time and I think this movie is worth checking out if you're a big horror fan!"},

Usually, January has been known to be a dumping ground for not-the-best movies. Of course, there are some exceptions. The new horror PRIMATE might be one of these for you. Lucy (Johnny Sequoyah) comes home from college to her sister Erin (Gia Hunter), their father Adam (Troy Kotsur), and their friends. Another member of the family is Ben (Miguel Torres Umba), a very smart chimpanzee. When Ben gets bit, he begins to lose himself, leading to a terrifying tale of survival in a big, beautiful glass cliffside mansion. They get stuck between a chimp and a hard place. This is director Johannes Roberts' best film to date, which honestly isn't saying much. The plot is super simple, as is the character development. There are plenty of horror tropes that they actually lean into for humour. I would've liked more humour overall though. What I really enjoyed were the visual effects on display here. While the chimp was a combination of both practical and CGI, the gore was all practical, which looked great. This is a very violent movie. They do a good job showing just how powerful and brutal chimps can be. With a pretty solid pace, the tension is palpable for most of the 90-minute runtime. These are smarter than the average slasher characters. The use of silence and sign language is utilized very well here, especially with the addition of Kotsur. Happy he's getting work after his award-winning role in CODA. I was quite entertained. Overall, PRIMATE is prime serviceable simian silliness, a movie that knows exactly what it is, and what the audience is there for.

A versatile multi-talent, he has dabbled in a variety of genres, while leaving his own unmistakable authorial stamp on each. From the operatic revenge of 'Oldboy' and the rest of the so-called Vengeance Trilogy, to the melancholic machinations of 'Decision to Leave', and even the off-kilter eroticism of 'Thirst,' his films are united by an enduring fascination with obsession, violence and moral rot."},

I can't believe I enjoyed every single moment of it. I'm a harsh critic, but this movie touched me so much that I practically couldn't move while watching it. I would say that the most powerful part of this film is its story, as well as its black comedy that both makes the audience laugh and makes them think. It is so well-made and everything is in its exact place that I can't find any particular fault with it, although it wasn't without its flaws. The pleasure of watching this film completely captivated me and reminded me once again that South Korean cinema is one of the best in all the countries. I suggest that if you want to see this movie, watch it when your mind is not too busy and you can pay close attention to the movie and its very interesting and memorable events. This movie will create funny, heartbreaking, sad, happy, and even scary moments for you."},

This is certainly not up there. The story seems to be a mish-mash of 'Parasite' and an old Michael Caine movie ' A shock to the system', but the story doesn't appear to be the problem here. Its the direction itself. The editing is no better. Just watch Handmaiden or OldBoy and you'll understand why we expect more from Park. Firstly the story takes too long to get set and shall we say a bit predictable. Black comedy needs the audience to be shocked or at least surprised and horrified at the outcome similar to some great skits on SNL..where the audience graon at the outcome. This is so predictable and mostly takes time to reveal even small surprises. The pacing is uneven and its a totally unsatisfying film by an auteur. His 'Decision to Leave' was slow but deliciously paced and interwoven and the shocks were ...shocks in the truest sense. The dude needs to take a break before his next film....because if 'Sympathizer' made by him was a bit flat and uninspired, this is no better. Time to recharge your batteries Sir !"},

This movie just really isn't a whole los and it's really boring in my personal opinion and I just couldn't really find any of this story interesting. The best part of the film was definitely seeing all these random disasters just destroy everything and everyone in its path and that was definitely the most intriguing and best part of the film. The movie starts to lose me with its weird and bad writing and dialogue and some scenes just felt like they zoomed by so fast for some reason and I felt like this movie had like some of its runtime just cut because some of the scenes just skip to something new. I also found the characters to be not interesting and the acting was also quite bad the only character I found somewhat enjoyable was John played by Gerard Butler and I thought he had a decent performance in this film but I just don't think Nathan is a good character at all he's so annoying I don't know if it's just me but he was absolutely unbearable for me. There's some decent cinematography and CGI with the disasters but some of the CGI has me dying especially like the first disaster near the start of the film it looked too funny to me. I just don't know why this movie needed to be made it just doesn't offer anything new and feels like a blatant cash grab for a January release. I also found it odd how many useless side characters are in this film and the they legit end up killing them in a few minutes like what did they add to the story? It just felt completely useless to add all these boring and uninteresting characters to this family dynamic. I think the production design was actually good though and I really loved that aspect of the film because some moments looked absolutely great so shoutout to the production design team! Overall this is definitely a typical bad January release and I just didn't enjoy this and I wouldn't recommend this."},

The movie offers a bit more action without losing too much of the emotional core that already distinguished its predecessor. This by no means implies that the first installment was significantly worse. Rather, the sequel places a stronger focus on action and effects, though without going overboard. Overall, the second film feels to me a small notch stronger, mainly because more happens and the pace remains consistently higher."},

Aurora's (Sophie Sloan) monster is more troublesome than your average bogeyman, ostensibly a dust bunny it grows into a huge dangerous creature. It even eats her parents. Fortunately for Aurora, a hitman (Madds Mikkelsen) lives in her building and she tries to hire him to kill the monster. She has followed him and seen him slay what she takes to be a monster, it was actually a Triad gang carrying a Dragon figure. The hitman thinks that her parents were slain by mobsters after him. To say more would be a spoiler. So the battle begins. Set mostly in a beautiful Art Deco apartment building this film has the feel and look of a Wes Anderson production about it, the costumes, wallhangings, furniture and wallpaper have such attention to detail. There is much violence and killings and maybe people are being eaten by a monster. But the choreographing of the fights is superb. A fine line of humour runs through the film, especially the exchanges between Aurora and the hitman. There is also a touch of Leon to the tale. Sigourney Weaver plays the hitman's rather ruthless handler. We learn some interesting details about Aurora's backstory which certainly puts another spin on the narrative. Great fun!

The pacing is uneven but the the acting is mostly decent, although there is too little dialogue for anyone to shine. The music is the most successfull part, pushing the whole thing toward psychedelia with its upbeat seventies rock.

We follow a hitman played by Mikkelsen who is hired by a little girl who is convinced that there is a monster under her bed that ate her parents, while a group of armed assailants come knocking at the door. This effectively turns the movie into a home invasion story with fantasy, action and horror elements in the third act. The little girl Aurora is fantastically played by Sophie Sloan.

I was not aware of the psychiatrist's (Rami Malek) involvement with Goering (Russell Crowe) before and during the trial, and that was some of the best parts of the movie. Also interesting was the part that Sgt. Howie Triest (Leo Woodhall) played during the trial - I had not heard of his story before, and I have read and studied a lot about WWII. Russell Crowe is brilliant as Goering and Malek is very good but not perfect. Now for some of the issues I have the film. The portrayal of Goering on the witness stand was very good, but it was not accurate - the movie implies that it was all in one day and it was not. Also, I did not like Slattery's over the top performance as the warden of the prison. Michael Shannon's performance as Justice Jackson was adequate but not compelling or accurate. There are some other minor inaccuracies that cause me to delete a couple of points from an otherwise excellent film, but I definitely recommend it for fans of fine drama."},

It's a Hollywood blockbuster in style, fudging and over-simplifying the narrative as these blockbusters tends to do, and tending to overdramatise the US involvement. The film-makers here made decisions which cluttered the narrative with side stories (the pope's story was an invention, and the translator's story was a quite unnecessary distraction). The scriptwriters couldn't decide whether this was a prisoner-psychologist story or a prosecutor-defendant-trial story so they skimmed through both narratives rather too briefly. And there were lots of very strangely filmed encounters, a dark nighttime conversation at the Nuremberg rally arena in particular. Russell Crowe was OK, but Rami Malek was poorly cast as the psychologist. And two psychologists in an angry body fight in seemingly empty prison corridor...that would never have happened!"},

One of the movie's prongs follows American Supreme Court Justice Robert Jackson (Michael Shannon), who fights hard for a war crimes trial for which there is no legal precedent. The larger, second prong is the interaction between American psychiatrist Douglas Kelley (Rami Malek) and Hermann Göring, which eventually includes Göring's wife, Emmy (Lotte Verbeek), and daughter, Edda (Fleur Bremmer).

Leo Woodall is attention-getting in a smaller role. He has a scene toward the end of the film that made me cry. There are some inaccuracies.

The film follows two disillusioned men who kidnap a corporate leader they believe to be an alien, but beneath its bizarre premise lies a scathing critique of paranoia, capitalism, and humanity's fragile relationship with truth. Emma Stone delivers a magnetic, layered performance, oscillating between vulnerability and menace, while Jesse Plemons brings a haunting intensity that grounds the surrealism. Lanthimos's signature offbeat tone, eerie symmetry, and deadpan humor turn each scene into both a moral puzzle and visual feast. Bugonia lingers in the mind long after the credits roll-a disturbing, darkly funny exploration of belief, control, and the madness lurking beneath modern reason."},

Brendan Fraser is fantastic, as are several of the Japanese actors.

While there are numerous minor story arcs, two main ones are each quite compelling; one involving a fatherless girl, and another a fading old man. Their stories will make you both smile and weep."},

I think this film is absolutely heart wrenching and just throws so much emotional moments towards you that it gets you really close to crying or crying already. Brendan Fraser is just absolutely phenomenal and truly delivered yet another absolutely remarkable performance and the moments between Mia and Kikuo had me absolutely so emotional and really just elevated this film even more for me. The story here is absolutely beautiful and it's really a fresh concept which has you really thinking about the storyline going here and how Hikari truly had a brilliant idea with a beautiful work of cinematography and visuals to deliver this film which elevates it even higher for me. I really love the film delves the audience into more about the Japanese culture as that's something I'm not too knowledge about and I love how the film portrays the culture of Japan and all the beauty's and how you can't uncover all of its secrets even if you lived there for 100 years like the film states. I really love the score for the film as well and there's such beautiful moments when the film relies on the score to help bring out more emotional moments with beautiful and astonishing visuals. I feel like the film was a little predictable but that's not anything bad about the film though I feel like sometimes I could just see where things were headed pretty easily I feel like I didn't mind that due to this incredible and emotional story that were following throughout the movie. It's so emotional and wholesome seeing Brendan Fraser's character of Phillip and how he's trying to just help these people if he can possibly can and how he's going out of his way to make sure these people can have memories that can change them for the better. I honestly just think this movie was absolutely fantastic and it had me balling my eyes out near the end of the film due to how beautiful this story truly was and hats off to Brendan Fraser for another incredible performance. This is definitely worth watching in my opinion for sure."},

Directed in fairly lockstep fashion by Hikari, this sentimental 2025 dramedy focuses on Phillip Vanderploeg, a middle-aged expat actor struggling to make a living in Tokyo after his initial success as the superhero mascot in a popular toothpaste commercial seven years earlier. He gets hired by the owner of a rent-a-family company looking for a \"token white guy\" to help clients in need of a missing family connection. Phillip tries mightily to overcome his innate resistance to the faux-family concept at which point the story concentrates on two roles he's hired to tackle: the estranged father of a biracial adolescent and a journalist interviewing an aging screen star suffering from dementia. Fraser maneuvers through the various plot machinations with genuine sincerity, but he could've benefited from a deeper, more complex script from Hikari and Stephen Blahut. For instance, it would've been more interesting to mine the psychology behind the loneliness felt in Japanese culture beyond the obvious impact on children and the elderly. On the upside, the cinematography by Takuro Ishikawa is captivating, and there are effective supporting turns from Takehiro Hira as the company owner, Mari Yamamoto as a cynical colleague, and Akira Emoto as the forgotten screen star."},

Throughout this two-hour journey, the audience are given insight into the many joys and throws of modern Japanese culture, whether it comes from cleverly written emotional dialogue or visual cues such as the Monster Cat Festival - yet the film is far from an oversimplification of modern Japan - as Takehiro Hira says in an opening sequence, you could live in Tokyo for 100s of years and still not uncover all of its secrets. Director Hikari builds upon this cultural foundation with a poignant and hilarious emotional odyssey, featuring gut-wrenching moments of pain juxtaposed by much needed comedic relief. Neither sides are done cheaply - although the plot is generally predictable, it does not need to be complex; the writing is intelligent enough by itself.

The visuals are stunning from start to finish, and the soundtrack is well done, even if not every song appealed to me personally. Jack O'Connell delivers a solid performance and is definitely the highlight of the movie."},

After finally watching it, I can say with confidence that this is my favorite movie to come out in 2025. When twin brother Smoke and Stack return home from Chicago to rural Mississippi for a fresh start, they decide to take what earnings they got left to open a nightclub. Unfortunately, other than some of their old hometown friends, old lovers, and a cousin, a much evil and greater force awaits for them just in time for the debut of their new night club. For starters, Michael B. Jordan gives probably the best performance of his career so far as the twins Smoke and Stack, bringing a different persona and personality to each of the characters. Hailee Steinfeld as Mary is magnificent and for the most part has some of the best character development of the film. Wunmi Mosaku as Annie is also great in this film, while also being a huge part of the heart and soul of it. Miles Caton as Sammie Moore is also a great addition to this film and plays a very important role in it. Omar Miller as Cornbread was also a great addition. Delroy Lindo as Delta Slim also gives a great supporting performance, while also having some of the best lines and moments of the movie. Finally Jack O' Connell as Remmick and the main villain of the movie was absolutely fantastic, terrifying, while also charming in a way and is probably one the best horror movie villains I've seen in recent years. Every time his character is on screen, he steals the show and more than gets the audience's attention. If there's anything negative I have to say about the film which is little to none, I would say in the first act, it took awhile for the story to get going, but once it does finally start to take off, it makes everything more than worth while. For positives, I would like to point out that music playing a huge role and technically a character itself in the film was sensational. The horror elements were also well done, as well as a couple of action scenes that were very impressive. Overall, Sinners is my favorite movie of 2025, with great performances all the way around, great cinematography, and a really great story with the direction of Ryan Coogler giving Jordan Peele a run for his money in the horror genre. Rating 10/10."},

The direction here stands out - with grainy close-ups, fast jump cuts, and jarring transitions reminiscent of the original film, it pulls you right into the chaos."},

However, I will say that the beginning started off great, but not with the intensity of the first two films. Then the follow up gave the film high hopes, but instantly came crashing down. Do not enter the theater thinking that you are about to watch a 28 days later trilogy because I don't know what the overarching message was behind what I just watched."},

There were certainly flashes of what made the original films so memorable - a few tense, edge-of-your-seat moments and some solid action sequences. But as a whole, I found the story disappointingly uneven. The narrative felt clunky and at times weighed down by overly sentimental scenes that didn't quite land emotionally. It seemed unsure of what it wanted to be, and by the final act, it became clear that the film was less about telling a complete story and more about setting up whatever comes next. That left me feeling a bit short-changed. It's not without its strengths, but for a film I had high hopes for, it just didn't deliver."},

Something interfered or tampered, perhaps the studio executives forcing it to be a trilogy. I think this was originally intended to be one story but the writer and director were forced to change it. While the first act was strong, the second and third act just felt odd, both rushed and stretched out at the same time. The characters just make weird, fruitless decisions. A plot device happens in the third act that is completely pointless and adds nothing to the depth of the story, and for what the previous installments were there isn't really a climax. At some points I felt like I was watching the Walking Dead where the infected are secondary to the plot. Idk, I just hope Cillian can redeem the series in the next entry."},

And the movie was I finished I thought that I would not ever say this but it was a disappointment how is this even apart of this world?. The movie felt really weird it didn't have the same feel as the other two films the editing was off I was not a fan of that. And a lot of the characters were through away characters you don't really care about them. If there is anybody I like Spike was that person and Dr. Kelson was cool. There are some cool things in here but really I think it's forgettable unfortunately. I will give this another rewatch to see if my thoughts have changed if I'am recommending any of the 3 watch the first two."},
